        "definition": "x-ray is a type of electromagnetic radiation characterized by wavelengths between approximately 103 Å and 10 - 4 Å , corresponding to photon energies of about 20 eV to 125 MeV . X-rays are invisible ; penetrative , especially at higher photon energies ; and travel with the same speed as visible light . Typical production involves bombarding a target of high atomic number with fast electrons in a high vacuum . They are also emitted as a product of some radioactive disintegrations . X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm C. Roentgen in 1895 ; hence the term roentgen rays . Roentgen called them x-rays after the mathematic symbol x for an unknown . Also the colloquial term for radiograph . See also radiograph .",
