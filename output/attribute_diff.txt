isA: operative procedure used to treat disease or repair abnormalities in the periodontium and associated teeth


definition: 
periodontitis is the alterations occurring in the periodontium with inflammation. Gingival changes are those of gingivitis, with the clinical signs associated with gingivitis. It has histologic characteristics, such as ulceration of the sulcular and junctional epithelium, epithelial hyperplasia, proliferation of epithelial rete pegs into the gingival tissues, apical migration of the epithelial attachment after lysis of the gingival fibers, increased cellular and exudative infiltrate, and vascularity of the lamina propria. Resorption of bone in an apical direction results in the loss of attachment of the periodontal fibers to the bone. A transseptal band of reconstituted periodontal fibers walls off the gingival inflammation from the underlying bone.
