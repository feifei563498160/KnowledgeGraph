the body’s metabolism are
excreted in urine in combination
with bases such as sodium and
potassium. These bases are
thereby lost to the body and acidbase
balance is maintained.

crown during the intermediate
stage in a large scale oral
reconstruction. However it has its
own disadvantages as it gets
detoriated in the oral cavity by
being worn away, discoloring
and due to marginal leakage.

Acrylic
is a dental material used for
prosthesis and various types of
appliances. It consists of powder
called polymer and a liquid called
monomer, when mixed it sets into
a hard acrylic by a process called
curing. Heat cured acrylic is used
for dentures and orthodontic
appliances. While cold cured
acrylic is used for denture repairs,
impression trays and temporary
crowns.

Acrylic jacket crowns
are used as
provisional crowns since they are
more permanent than the usual
simple temporary procedures and
less costly than cast metal crowns.

change in the membrane potential
of excitable nerve and muscle
cells associated with the
conduction of impulses along the
cell membrane.

Action tremors
range in speed
between 7 to 11 Hz and more
distally than proximally. Such
tremors can easily be suppressed
by beta blockers. Alcohol may
abolish but withdrawal tremors
may appear again.

Activation phase
is the activation
phase of endothelial binding
triggers by factors binding to
receptors on neutrophils surface.
They include fragments of
collagen, soluble factors, by
products of complement cascade,
Chemokines, PAF, Leukotriene
B4, and PGD2. Each leukocyte
chemotactic factor is recognized
by a specific receptor on the
leukocyte surface of the
transmembrane receptor family.
Contact with even minute
amount of such a factor either
dissolved in the blood or bound
to the endothelial surface triggers
diameter changes in the surface
adhesion properties of neutrophils.
It also induces changes in
the conformation of integrins on
leukocyte surfaces enabling them
to bind specific glycoprotein
ligands on endothelium. Chemokines
unmasks the binding
activities of integrins called
MAC–1 Leukocyte Functional Ag
(LFA), which can then bind to
ICAM-1 on activated endothelial
cell.

refers to the
emergence of the tooth in the oral
cavity from its position in the jaw
(see Figure on page 8).

Active exercises
are movements of
body due to voluntary contraction

by that micro-organism is
conferred to the individual if the
body recovers from the disease.

Active memory
refers to the shortterm
memory.

Acupressure
is a type of therapy
where physician puts light and
medium pressure on certain
specific points. Their aim is to
stimulate the body’s electromagnetic
energy to help body’s
own recuperative powers to
remove energy blockage. Blockage
is due to production of lactic
acid and carbon monoxide in
muscle tissue resulting in stiff
musculature. Removal of blockage
relaxes the whole body.

Acupuncture
is a system of science
where the needles are inserted
into patient’s skin to treat
diseases. Chinese thought that life
force flows through the meridians.

redness may extend to lower
eyelid. Submandibular lymph
node may be enlarged and tender.
Acute epididymitis occurs when
the route of infection is via
urethra to the ejaculatory duct

inflammation of gingiva, it is the
disease of sudden onset and short
duration; the condition may be
painful in nature.

patients with chronic hepatitis
present less acutely with a history
of months that could be mostly
tuberculous in origin.

Acute herpes’ zoster
is due to the
neurotropic virus travelling along
the involved nerve. It causes
neuritis and vesicular disease of
skin and mucous membrane.
Eruption is located to a single
dermatome. High dose antiviral
therapy in acute phase of herpes
zoster improves the rate of
healing. Intensity of pain is also
reduced. Post-herpetic neuralgia
may continue in old persons.

incident. It may be followed by
mania and lucid interval cyclically.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
is a clinical syndrome
caused by a deficient coronary
arterial blood supply to a region
of myocardium that results in cellular
death and necrosis. This syndrome
is usually characterized by
severe and prolonged substernal
pain but more intense and longer
duration than angina pectoris.
Cause of acute myocardial infarction
in more than 90% of cases is
coronary artery disease. Other
risk factors include obesity and
undue stress, also elevated blood
pressure and/or elevated blood
cholesterol. Immediate predisposing
failures for AMI include a
significant decrease in blood flow
through the coronary arteries, as
in coronary thrombosis (see Figure
on page 12).

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG)
is an endogenous
oral infection having necrosis of
gingiva. Blood diseases and
severe nutritional deficiencies
may also result in it. It develops
sudden pain, tenderness, profuse
salivation and spontaneous bleeding.
Typical fetid odor develops.
Lesion consist of painful,
punched out, necrotic ulcers developing
on interdental papillae
and gingival margin but lips,
tongue and palate may also be
involved. Gingiva bleeds on
touch and is covered by a gray,
necrotic pseudomembrane. Patient
is not able to eat. Pain is a
superficial pressure type. Trench
mouth was the term given during
World War I when in trenches
soldiers suffered from acute necrotizing
of ulcerative gingivitis.

condition. Sudden onset of acute
excruciating epigastric pain with
radiation to back is the main
complaint. Pain is more in supine

abscess associated with a partially
erupted tooth or fully erupted
tooth that is covered completely or
partially by a flap of tissue.

Acute phase response
is most
soluble mediators of innate
immunity found in relatively
small amount in the serum under
normal conditions. Concentration
of these proteins can increase 1000
fold during serious injury as part
of co-ordinated protective
response called “Hepatic acute
phase response’. Liver temporarily
increases its synthesis of more
than a dozen serum proteins that
participate in antimicrobial
defense. Response occurs when
hepatocytes are exposed to
certain cytokines like 1L-6, 1L-1,
TNF, LPS of bacteria.

with periorbital hematoma.
Hematuria may be gross or
microscopic with oliguria. Both
kidneys are swollen. External
surface can be smooth with
petechiae.

Acute pulpalgia
refers to the
development of pulpal inflammation
or pulpitis. Increased intrapulpal
pressure is the stimulus
that is applied to the sensory
nerves of the pulp and leads to
severe toothache. It occurs with a
large carious lesion or with
restoration. Severe pain is elicited
with thermal changes especially
cold. Pain is of lancinating type.
Intensity of pain increases when
patient lies down, when entrance
to the diseased pulp is not wide
pain becomes severe. Pulp
contains large number of bacteria.
There is no specific treatment and
once pulpitis occurs, the damage
is irreparable. Tooth involved
with acute pulpitis may be treated
by pulp therapy.

Acute pyelonephritis
this condition
is uncommon in contrast to acute
cystitis. Vesicoureteric infection,
pregnancy and instrumentation
may predispose to it. Diabetes
predisposes to infection. Person
develops loin pain, high fever and
often rigors. There may be much
destruction of cortex sparing of
glomeruli and blood vessels.

is a sudden
onset of renal failure generally
associated with Liguria. In a few
weeks renal function is restored.
There are two mechanisms
ischemia and nephrotoxicity.

Acute retroviral syndrome

viral syndrome occurring
1-6 weeks following HIV
exposure. Many of the clinical
features may go unrecognized.
Symptoms include fever, sweats,
malaise, truncal rash, mouth pain
and neck stiffness. Liver and
spleen are enlarged. Fever with
lymphadenopathy develops.

Acute suppurative osteomyelitis
is
a squeale of periapical infection.
Dental infection is the commonest
cause. Staphylococcus aureus and
staphylococcus albus are the
commonest one. Maxilla or
mandible may be involved. There
will be severe pain, enlargement
of lymph glands. WBC count is
elevated. Once periostitis
develops there is no swelling or
reddening of skin. On X-ray lytic
lesion is noted. Individual
trabeculae becomes fuzzy and
indistinct. Separated fragment of
dead bone is called sequestrum.
For large sequestrum surgical
removal is to be done.

which working end of an
instrument is placed against the
surface of the tooth to get
maximum adaptability or
proximity to the tooth surface and
avoid soft tissue trauma.

is said
to have occurred when innate
system is breached, a specific
response is mounted to each
infectious agent and the infectious
agent is remembered to prevent
it causing infection later.

part toward the middle of the
body.

Adenoameloblastoma
arises from
residual odontogenic epithelium.
In early stage tumor is completely
radiolucent. It may be solid or
may contain large cystic areas. It
forms duct like structures. Site of
occurrence is more in maxilla.
Vast majority measure 1.5 to 3 cm.
Minute calcifications are also seen
under microscope. In advanced
stage, sufficient calcification
occurs to produce clusters of
radiopaque foci with the
radiolucency. Majority occurs in
unerupted tooth or in the walls of
dentigerous cyst. Mostly involved
teeth are maxillary canine, lateral
incisors, mandibular premolar.
Slow growth expands the cortical
plates and produces a clinical
signs of swelling and asymmetry
is seen. Radiographs shows
destructive lesions of jaw which
may or may not be well
circumscribed. Soft tissues are not
involved.

Adenocarcinoma
occurs more
commonly in relation to minor
salivary glands. The tumor is slow
growing with no surface
ulceration. It is a painless mass.
Later on tumor grows faster.
Swelling becomes painful.
Ulceration and loss of sensation
develops. Under microscope one
can see numerous proliferating
malignant ductal epithelial cells.
There will be areas of hemorrhage
and necrosis (see Figure on
page 15).

Adenocystic carcinoma
is a
malignant neoplasm arising from
glandular epithelium. It is a most
common malignant tumor of
submandibular salivary gland.
Glands of palate and tongue can
also be involved. Parotid tumor
produces a subcutaneous mass
anterior to or below the external
ear. Pain is a very common feature
in this tumor. There is fixation and
induration of tumor. Submandibular
gland tumors become quite
large. While palatal lesions are
often accompanied by delayed
healing of socket once tooth has
been extracted. If greater palatine
nerve is involved palatal parasthesia
will develop. Treatment
involves excision followed by
radiotherapy because tumor cells
are radiosensitive.

Adenofibroma
is a frequent
neoplasm of youth occurring
below the age of 25 years. These
are usually small, painless tumors
discovered incidently. Adenofibroma

develops in parotid gland tumor
is superficially lying just beneath
the parotid capsule. It is firm but
not palpable. It consists of cystic
spaces with intraluminar
projections. It contains lot of
lymphoid tissue. It may develop
due to proliferation of ectopic
salivary gland tissue. Some think
that it is a hemartous growth than
a true neoplastic lesion. It
comprises 20% of all parotid
tumors. It is well encapsulated
and movable. It is a slow growing
well circumscribed soft and
painless, and can grow up to 2-4
cm in diameter. It gives a
compressible and doughy feeling
on palpation, on cut surface
confluent cystic spaces are seen
and chocolate colored fluid comes
out. Dense fibrous capsule
surrounds it. Malignant transformation
is rare. Surgical
excision is to be done.

discrete nodule. These arise from
follicular epithelium known as
follicular adenomas. It is well
circumscribed solitary, round,
rubbery, firm and well
capsulated. Cut surface is brown
and translucent.

inch. Right is pyramidal in shape
while left one is crescent shaped.
Adrenal cortex produces and
secretes more than 30 steroid
hormones, of which cortisol, a
glucocorticoids, is widely
considered the most important.
Cortisol helps the body adapt to
stress.

Adrenaline
is a hormone secreted
by medulla of adrenal glands. It
is first hormone to be discovered.

due to its liberation. Blood sugar
and BMR also rises. Chemically
it is hydroxyl, dihydroxy phenyl
ethylemethyline.

stage of pulpal pathology where
the pain is very severe the most
excruciating acute pain known to
man. Patient may even become
hysterical due to pain. Relief from
this pain is embarrassingly by
simple cold water. The history is
self-incriminating. Symptoms are
violent. The involved tooth
usually can be pointed out by
patient and is tender to
percussion too. Because the
inflamed pulp reacts so violently
to heat, the most decisive test is
the heat test. As soon as not guttapercha
touches the involved
tooth, the patient develops
subgluteal vacuum and patient
rises up in the chair as if stabbed.
Cold water is instantly applied
and pain subsides. Local
anesthesia gives blessed relief.

most commonly used restorative
material. It’s one of the metal is
mercury which gives silver color
to the filling thus commonly it is
also known as silver filling. In
average deep cavities, the pulp is
affected mainly by the cold and
hot stimuli that result from the
thermal conductive properties of
amalgam. In such cavities pain is
due to unlined cavities resulting
in an inflammatory response after
3 days to 5 weeks. Marginal
leakage that occurs due to

tooth are basically normal. The
anomaly occurs in the general
population in the range of 1 in
14,000. Three basic type of
amelogenesis imperfecta are
hypoplastic: Type in which there
is defective formation of matrix,
hypocalcification type in which
there is defective mineralization
of the formed matrix, Hypomaturation

isoleucine, leucine, lysine,
methionine, phenylalanine,
theonine, tryptophan and valine.
Growing children needs histidine.

Aminoglycosides
are bactericidal.
They cause misreading of mRNA
by the ribosome, leading to
abnormal protein production. To
enter the bacterium, aminoglycosides
need to be actively
transported across the cell
membrane. This does not occur in
anaerobic organisms, which are
therefore, resistant.

liver abscesses contain reddish
brown fluid and cellular necrotic
tissue.

Amoebic liver abscess
is a
condition where E. histolytica
invades colonic mucosa and
carried to liver by portal
circulation to form microabscess.
Microabscesses confluent to make
larger one. Posterior lobe is the
commonest site to form abscess.
There will be abdominal pain,
fever, rigor and sweating. In
pleural irritation one will develop
intercostals tenderness and
cough. As complication it may
rupture into pleural, pericardial
sac or into peritoneal cavity.
Radiograph will show elevated
right dome with restricted
mobility. Metronidazole and
Ampicillin in high doses is
effective (see Figure).

Amoebic lung abscess
develops by
spreading across the diaphragm
from liver. It is more common in
liver. Prior to rupture of amoebic

together in spinal cord. It can
occur with paresthesia. It can be
classified partial or total below the
level of lesion. When develops
abruptly it is due to trauma.

Analgesics
are drugs used to

statistical tests used to analyse
differences between two or more
groups based on positioning the
sum of squares into that A
attributable to between group
differences and that attributable
to within group differences.

reaction or an acute, severe,
allergic reaction characterized by
sudden collapse, shock or
respiratory/circulatory failure
following an injection of an
allergen where there is exaggerated
immunologic reaction
that results from release of
vasoactive substances such as
histamine. There is an increased
susceptibility to an allergen
resulting from previous exposure
to it.

crown, extending from cusp tip
to the cementoenamel (CE)
junction.

be saccular, fusiform, mycotic
and dissecting aneurysm.

Angina pectoris classification
includes
stable angina / classic angina
which is usually the result of
coronary artery disease. Stable
angina is triggered by strenuous
activity, emotional stress or cold
weather. The ‘pain’ of stable angina
lasts from 1-15 minutes and
builds gradually. The pain of
stable angina is relieved by rest
or administration of nitroglycerin.
Variant angina /Prinzmetal’s angina
— more likely to occur when
patient is at rest than during
physical exertion or emotional
stress. Coronary artery spasm is
the cause of variant angina. Variant
angina is more common in
women under the age of 50 years.
Signs apart from chest pain, syncope,
dyspnea and palpitation.
Nitroglycerin usually provides
prompt relief of pain. Unstable
angina— Lies intermediate between
stable angina and acute
myocardial infarction. Unstable
angina is the result of progression
of atherosclerosis. Episodes of
pain associated with unstable angina
may persist for up to 30 minutes.
Three characteristics used to
define unstable angina, i.e. angina
of recent onset, caused by minimal
exertion, increasingly severe,
prolonged or frequent angina,
angina both at rest and with minimal
exertion.

Angina pectoris
Angina a Latin
word describing a spasmodic,

minutes rest and result of a
moderate inadequacy of coronary
circulation.

larynx. It may cause respiratory
obstruction needing tracheostomy.
It is due to release of
histamine from sensitized most
cells in face and buccal cavity.

Angio-neurotic edema
is a nonhereditary
form and is due to
food allergy. It manifests itself as
a smooth diffuse edematous
swelling involving face, lips, chin
and eyes. Feeling of itching or
pricky sensation is there. Skin is
of normal color. Hereditary form
has visceral involvement and is
serious. Edema develops due to
vascular swelling.

Angioplasty

in which vessels occluded by
arteriosclerosis are opened. This
technique was developed in 1977.
This is done in patients who don’t
respond to medical treatment as
well as don’t require by pass
surgery also.

Angiosarcoma
is the malignant
vascular neoplasm and not HIV
related; oral cavity is the rare site.

by the intersection of glabella –
subnasale line and subnasale –
soft tissue pogonion line. Mean
value is 12° and SD is ± 4°. A
smaller positive or negative value
suggests a class III relationship. A
high positive value reflects a class
II relationship. The value of this
angle, however, does not reveal
the localization of the deformity.

Angle of mandible
is an area of
mandible where body meets the
ramus.

Anglo-Saxon system
is a method
used for diagnosing pit and fissure
caries, which consists of certain
“liberal” criteria’s, described
by Horowitz, HS, in 1972. Description
of the system: The pits
and fissures on the occlusal, vestibular
and lingual surfaces are
carious when the explorer
“catches” after insertion with
moderate to firm pressure and
when the “catch” is accompanied
by one or more of the following
signs of decay: Softness is noted
at the base of the area. Opacity
adjacent to the area provides evidence
of undermining or demineralization.
Softened enamel
adjacent to the area may be
scraped away by the explorer.
These areas should be diagnosed
as sound when there is apparent
evidence of demineralization, but
no evidence of softness.

joints are first to be noticed.
Peripheral joints when involved
don’t show any demineralization
or erosion. Non-steroid anti
inflammatory drugs are used.

Ankylosis
is the term given to the
fusion between cementum of
teeth and the underlying bone.
Generally the deciduous teeth are
affected in which bone has fused
to cementum and dentin
preventing exfoliation of tooth
and eruption of underlying
permanent tooth. Tooth erupts
into oral cavity but does not reach
the occlusal plane. In addition
adjacent permanent teeth are
taller occlusocervically. Ankylosed
tooth sounds solid on
percussion.

correlation of this criterion with
the length of the jaw bases enables
the assessment of the proportional
averages of these bases.

Anterior cross bite
is a condition
characterized by reverse over jet
where one or more maxillary
anterior teeth are in lingual
relation to the mandibular teeth.
Anterior cross bites should be
intercepted and treated at an early
stage so as to prevent a minor
orthodontic problem from
progressing into a major dentofacial
anomaly. An old orthodontic
maximum states “The best
time to treat a cross bite is the first
time it is seen”.

methotrexate is antagonist of folic
acid; antibiotics interfere with
vitamin K synthesis. These are
known to be present in natural
foods, e.g. thiaminase in raw fish.
Some synthetic antagonists of
vitamins are used as drugs in the
therapy of neoplasm, e.g.

ulcers produce larger ulcers and
takes longer time to heal. It heals
by scarring and at least one ulcer
is always present. Herpetiform
aphthae present multiple painful
ulcers of 1 to 20 mm affecting nonkeratinized
area. Ulcers are
superficial with an erythematous

be manifested by a coughing
spell, with or without sputum
production and wheezing.
Breathing during an asthmatic
attack is labored. Blood pressure
may rise in acute episode attacks,
also heart rate increases rate of
more than 120 beats/minute. If
left untreated, acute asthmatic
episode may last minutes or
hours. Termination of attack is
usually heralded by a period of
intense coughing with expectoration
of a thick, tenacious mucus
plug. This is followed immediately
by a sensation of relief and a
clearing of the air passages.

Asymmetric Tonic Neck Reflex
shows that when the body is at
rest and not crying, the patient
keeps his head on one side, the
arms and the legs on the same side
extend, while the opposite limbs
go into flexion. The reflex is
prominent between 2nd and 4th
month. Persistence of the reflex
beyond the age of 6 to 9 months
or a constant neck posture is
abnormal and usually indicates
spastic cerebral palsy or poor
control over the motor functions.

Asymmetry
is to be occurred when
aesthetic, tooth size, shape and
gum contour are not as close to
identical from one side of the
mouth to the other. Ideally, the

and slowly progressive disorder
of aorta and large and medium
sized muscular arteries. It is the
main cause of arteriosclerosis.
Lesion develops slowly over
years. Atherosclerosis is known to
undergo ulceration, hemorrhage,
calcification and thrombosis.
Hypertension accelerate atherosclerosis
which in turn increases
chances of ischemic heart disease.

Athetosis
is a slow, purposeless
writhing movement of limbs, face
or tongue. These movements
increase when patient carries out
voluntary movements. Posthemiplegic
athetosis is unilateral.

Attached gingiva
is the part of
gingiva which is in continuation
with the marginal gingiva. It is
firm and resilient and tightly
bound to the underlying
periosteum of the alveolar bone.
In children, it appears less dense
and redder than in adults due to
less keratinized epithelium with
its greater vascularity. The
attached gingiva is more black
because of lesser connective tissue
density and its texture is less
stippled. The two unique
characteristics of the attached
gingiva in children are the
interdental clefts and the
retrocuspid papilla. The interdental
clefts are normal anatomic
feature found in the interradicular
zones underlying the saddle
areas. The retrocuspid papilla is
found approximately 1mm below
the free gingival groove on the
attached gingiva lingual to the

poorly localized and pain of
vascular origin in head becomes
difficult to separate from atypical
facial pain. Atypical facial pain
is not associated with trigger
zones.

patient’s own skin which is best
used to cover the wounds. The
best donor site is the patient’s
thighs or upper arm. But in case
of extensive burns these areas can
be reused to obtain grafts again
after 2 weeks because usually thin
grafts are taken. In case the area
is extensive, scalp is a good donor
site because it can be reused many
times as a donor area.

that develops on the sun exposed
surface over skin. It does not
metastasize. It generally involves
middle one third of face in 4th
decade of life. It arises from basal
layer of epidermis or from hair
follicle. Direct strong sun light is
the causative factor. It starts as a
small, elevated papule which
ulcerates, heals over and then
breaks down. Untreated lesion
grows on. Common site involved
includes upper lip, nasolabial
folds, cheek, forehead etc. It does
not arise from oral mucus
membrane. It starts as a slow
growing small nodule. It
develops into central crusted
ulcer with an elevated but smooth
rolled border. It develops as a sole

Beer
is an alcoholic beverage
produced by fermentation of
cereals. First step is malting of
barley. On sprouting, enzyme
amylase develops which
hydrolyses starch into dextrin’s
and maltose. Sprouted barley is
dried and extracted with hot
water to produce wort. Then hops
are added to ferment. A slow
fermentation is continuously
increasing the alcoholic content
and forming the CO2. Beer
contains 3-7% alcohol and 30-60
k cal per 100 ml.

Behavior learning theory
is a
learned behavior and confirm to
the laws of learning theory with
no underlying causes and no
more emotional or psychologic
problems. The learning theory
advocates that nonnutritive
sucking stems from adaptive
response. According to this
theory since habit behavior is
learned, it can presumably be
unlearned. For instance an infant
associates sucking with
pleasurable feelings such as
hunger, satiety and being held.
These events will be replaced in
later life by transferring the
sucking action to the most
suitable objects available namely,
the thumb or fingers. Learning
theorists say that conditioning
results in the development of
habit (Pavlov 1928). A conditioned
reflex is a reflex response,
acquired by repeated pairing the
stimulus with another stimulus
that normally does produce the
response. This is an example of
one stimulus to another. Conditioning
and stimulus generalization
can intimate a habit, which if
continuously repeated or reinforced
will become a learned
pattern.

Behavior therapy
is an application
of interventions based on an
understanding of learning
principles.

treatment.

Benjamin theory (1960)
says,
Thumb sucking arises from the
rooting or placing reflex seen in
all mammalian infants. Rooting
reflex is the movement of the
infant’s head and tongue towards

object is usually the mother’s
breast but may also be a finger or
a pacifier. This rooting reflex
disappears in normal infants
around 7-8 months.

a classic example of a biofilm. So
is the plaque that forms in the oral
cavity. Biofilms are everywhere in
nature. They form under fluid
conditions. It is estimated over 95
percent of bacteria existing in
nature are in biofilms. Sometimes
biofilms are seen as positive
source used for detoxification of
waste water and sewage. More
often biofilms provide a challenge
for humans. Human biofilm
infections include dental cavities,
gum diseases, ear infections and
some infections of the prostate
gland and heart. When bacteria in
a biofilm aggregate on surfaces,
they produce copious amounts of
a sugary, mucus coating. In case
of our mouth, teeming bacteria
can in just a few hours erect the
microscopic equivalent of a coral
reef on our teeth. Biofilm refers
to a polysaccharide layer containing
colony forming bacteria.

Black lesions
are the lesions that
occur due to foreign body
deposition. It may be developed
due to altered blood pigment and

gingival margin also known as
brown stain. The stain appears as
a continuous or interrupted line
following the gingival margin.
This line may be 1 mm wide with
no appreciable thickness or it may
also appear as heavy deposits
which will be slightly elevated
from the tooth surface and is
easily detectable. The teeth
frequently appear clean and shiny
with a lower tendency to bleed.
Black stain has a calculus like
appearance and is generally
composed of microorganisms
embedded deep in a matrix.
These stains can occur at any age
but are more common in childhood,

ulcer with undurated borders.
Patients will show pulmonary
lesions on X–ray. It may cause
shortness of breathing, weight
loss and blood tinged sputum.
There will be development of
painless ulcer with indurated
borders. In some cases hard
nodules and radiolucent jaw
lesions can be seen. Diagnosis is
made on biopsy.

the arterial blood vessels and
second is the pressure against the
blood vessels as the heart relaxes
between contractions. It is known
as diastole.

is a test used to assess
the level of sugar in blood. Fasting
blood sugar is 80-100 mg/100 ml.
The level rises after meals 140 mg/
100 ml but rapidly returns to

from diabetes. Glucose provides
energy and is stored in liver as
glycogen.

develops
from diminished or absent blue
receptors.

Blue grass appliance (1991)
was
introduced by Haskell, this is a
habit breaking appliance for
children with a continued thumb
sucking habit, which is affecting
the mixed or permanent
dentition. It consists of a modified
six sided roller machined from
teflon to permit purchase of the
tongue. This is slipped over a
0.045 stainless steel wire soldered
to molar orthodontic bands. This
appliance is placed for 3-6
months. Instructions are given to
turn the roller instead of sucking
the digit. Digit sucking is often
seen to stop immediately.

Blue lesions
is no biological
blue pigment. Some cystic lesions
containing clear fluid appear blue
and some vascular lesions may
also look blue when blood within
the lesion contains a large amount
of reduced hemoglobin. Shade of
blue color may be altered by the
thickness of overlying mucosa.
Darker blue is seen with most
superficial lesion.

Blue nevi
are due to benign
proliferation of melanocytes.
Nevocellular nevi arise from basal

lesion of oral cavity. These are
commonly seen on the mucosal
surfaces of hard palate. It is a
dome shaped dark blue papule.
Cells of blue nevus are elongated,
bipolar and spindle shaped. Few
pigmented macrophages may be
present. These don’t change into
malignancy and hence surgical
resection serves the purpose.
Compound nevus presents the
combined features of intradermal
nevus and junctional nevus.
These may be seen at any age.
Biopsy is needed simple excision
is the treatment of choice.

hairy areas and does not occur on
palm of hand. Swelling is small
and conical having a point. A
black dot may be present in the
center of swelling.

Boiling
is a process of sterilization
used when other proper facilities
for sterilization is not available.
Boiling for 20 minutes may be
done. Boiling does not render
spores nonviable hence is not
very reliable and effective.
Needles and syringes are generally
sterilized this way.

Bolus

squamous cell carcinoma.
It may develop into invasive
carcinoma over years. Clinically
it is a slow enlarging
erythematous patch. Histologically

brachial artery located on the
inner side of the elbow.

Bracket
is small device attached to
the teeth that holds the arch wire
to the teeth.

Bradykinesia
is the slowness of all
voluntary movement and speech.
It is due to reduced level of
dopamine. It is noted in
Parkinsonism. Certain drugs may
also cause it. There may be tremor
and muscle rigidity.

Bradykinin
is an endogenous
polypeptide released from the
inflammatory reaction site. It
serves as a powerful vasodilator
and excites all types of receptors,
sensitizing some high threshold
receptors to respond to otherwise
innocuous stimuli. It acts only in
the presence of prostaglandin.

Bradypnea
is a life threatening
apnea or respiratory arrest.
Respiration is regular but rate is
12 per minute. It may result due
to drug overdose.

attached crowns (abutments and
pontics). Artificial tooth is known
as pontic and supporting teeth are
called abutments. The crown on the
abutment teeth are called retainers.

Bridge threader
is a flexible plastic
device used to floss under a fixed
bridge to remove plaque from the
interproximal surfaces.

Bristle brush
is an attachment to
the hand piece to remove stain
from occlusal surfaces of teeth.

polishing instrument available in
wheel and cup shapes. These
brushes are used with hand
pieces along with a polishing
paste.

can be
characterized by thin bones and
lack the usual cortex of compact
bone. Development of epiphyseal
cartilage is unimpaired.

Broadbent’s inverted sign
includes pulsations in the left
posterolateral chest wall during
ventricular systole. Put your palm
over areas of visible pulsation
while hearing for ventricular
systole. Rate, rhythm and
pulsation will be high. It is due to
gross dilatation of left atrium.

Broca’s aphasia
is striking difficulty
with speech though they fully
understand what is being said.
They can make nonverbal
responses. Milder form results in
hesistency of speech.

Brodies abscess
occurs in patient
is between 10-20 years of age.
Upper end of tibia and lower end
of femur are the common sites. A
deep boring pain is the main
symptom which may be worst at
night. X-ray shows oval lucent
area. Treatment is by operation.

Bronchial breathing
originates
from large airways when lung
between these air ways and chest
wall is airless due to consolidation,
collapse or fibrosis. Sound
resembles as listening over
trachea. Quality of sound is harsh
and of higher frequency. It
becomes inaudible just before the
end of inspiration.

Bronchiectasis
is a congenital or
acquired disorder with dilatation
and destruction of bronchial wall.
Cystic fibrosis and recurrent
infection cause it. Symptoms
include chronic cough, production
of copius amount of purulent
sputum, hemoptysis and
Brittle bone syndrome
recurrent pneumonia. Clubbing is
frequent and copious foul
smelling purulent sputum is
characteristic.

Bronchodilator
is the dilatation of
the bronchi in order to facilitate
breathing.

Bronchogenic carcinoma
is mostly
amongst smokers. Patient presents
with anorexia and weight loss.
There develops new cough or
changes in cough. 25% will show
hemoptysis. Some may develop
pneumonia or pleural effusion.
Sputum cytology is highly specific
but not sensitive. CT helps in
diagnosis. 5 years survival is only
in 5% cases (see Figure on page 63).

Bronchopneumonia
is a multifocal
process which starts in terminal
and respiratory bronchioles and
produces patchy consolidation
caused by s. aureus and gram
negative organisms.

occurs
in scattered nodular fashion
around the bronchi. Lesion may
be of a few mm to 1 cm.
Bronchioles show exudates and
lining may show ulceration.
Bronchiole is surrounded by a
zone of consolidation.

Bronchospasm
is a generalized
contraction of smooth muscules
of bronchi and bronchioles
resulting in constriction of
bronchi and mucosal edema.
Expiratory phase is more
involved and may become life
threatening.

Brown lesions
may be caused by
melanin or hemosiderin. Melanin
is a substance produced within
melanocyte by melanosomes. An
increase in brown pigmentation
may be brought by increased
number of melanocytes. Increased
number of melanocytes
forms different benign and
malignant neoplasms. Heat, ultra
voilet rays and X-rays may
increase melanin synthesis.
Brown color resulting from
hemosiderin is associated with
crusting and drying of ulcerated
lesions.

Brown staining of tooth
is a thin,
brown delicate pellicle like
structure. It may be composed of
salivary mucin.

Brown stains due to betel leaf
will
give rise to stains which can vary
in color from dark brown to deep
mahogany brown to black. These
stains generally contain microorganisms
and mineralized content
which has the characteristic
resemblance to the sub-gingival
calculus.

Brown stains due to brown pellicle
is smooth and structureless and
recurs readily after removal. The
pellicle can take on stains of
various colors.

Brown stains due to chlorhexidine mouth rinses
are the excellent
agents for the plaque control, but
repeated use of these agents may
give rise to brownish stains on the
tooth surfaces generally affecting
the proximal surface of the tooth.

Brown stains due to food pigments
are resulting from
pigments leaching out of the food
such as turmeric stains, stains
from tea, coffee, and use of
artificial colors give rise to various
stains.

Brown stains due to stannous fluoride
appears sometimes as
light brown or light yellow, which
forms on to the tooth surface after
the prolonged or the repeated use
of stannous fluoride product
which results in the formation of
brown tin oxide due to the
reaction of the tin ion and fluoride
compound.

Bruxism
is an involuntary
grinding, clinching of teeth
specially done during sleep as a
result mostly of stress and
tension. It causes abnormal wear
of teeth. Bruxism is also called a
night grinding. It may happen
during sleep or during waking
hours. Occlusal disturbance may
cause it. Emotional tension may
be expressed through a number
of nervous habits, bruxism is one
of them. It may be associated with
grinding or grating noise.
Bruxism is defined as the grinding
of teeth for nonfunctional
purposes. Some authors refer to
nocturnal grinding as bruxism
and grinding during the day as
brunomiania. Which could be
due to psychological and emotional
stresses, occlusal interference
or discrepancy between centric
relation and centric occlusion can
predispose to grinding, pericoronitis
and periodontal pain may
also trigger bruxism.

Buccal
is pertaining to the cheek.

Buccal nerve block
is an injection
to provide pain control to the soft
tissues facial to the mandibular
molars.

is a rule for the
orientation of structures seen in
two radiographs exposed at
different angles used to determine
buccal lingual relationship
of an object.

Buccal pouch keratosis
Habit of
tobacco chewing may be
maintained for decades giving
rise to keratosis where there is
white thickening and wlinkling of
buccal mucosa. There is wrinkling
of buccal mucosa. Malignant
change can follow after decades.

Buccal space
refers to the space
existing between buccinator and
masseter muscle. Infection of this
space may lead to swelling of the
cheek and may extend to temporal
or submandibular space,
with which the buccal space
communicates.

Buccal wall
refers to cavity wall
nearest to cheek.

Buccinator muscle
refers to the
cheek muscle.

Buccinator

muscle occupying interval
between maxilla and mandible. It
is supplied by lower buccal
branches of facial nerve. It compresses
the cheeks against the teeth.

Bullous pemphigoid
is a skin
lesion and has limited life of five
years. Initial defect is in lamina
lucida of basement membrane.
There is no acanthylosis. Bullae
don’t extend to periphery.
Lesions remains localized and
heal spontaneously. Oral lesions
are smaller, mild painful and
grow slowly. Histologically only
one can notice bulla formation in
subepithelial region. Systemic
corticosteriods are useful. Bullous
pemphigoid is basically a disease
of an old age. Generalized nonspecific
rash develops vesicles
and bullae are thick walled and
remain intact for some days.

teeth may be enveloped in
dentigerous cyst.

Burn of oral mucosa
is a frequent
cause of transient nonkeratotic
white lesions. Saliva protects
mucosa from chemical and
thermal burn. Ingestion of caustic
liquids results in oropharyngeal
burns. Mild thermal burn of
anterior tongue is the result of
accidental ingestion of hot food.
Application of 70% ethyl alcohol
to dry mucosa will result in
sloughing.

Burning Mouth Syndrome
is a
painful, burning sensation
localized in the tongue or affecting
other areas of oral mucosa. The
pain of burning tongue is rated
similar to that of toothache.
Tongue temperature is decreased.
Some evidence suggests the
existence of oral somatosensory
and special sensory deficits.

Burning tongue
presents
paresthesia of oral mucus
membrance a common clinical
finding. Pernicious anemia,
diabetes, gastric disturbances and
psychogenic factors may result in
it. Tongue is commonly involved.
Pain, burning, etching and
stinging of mucus membrane are
felt. No satisfactory treatment is
available.

Burnishing
is smoothing the
surface of a dental amalgam after
initial carving by rubbing with a
metal instrument having a broad
surface.

Burns
is any injury to skin by an
energy source. This source of
energy could be heat —which
could be by fire or by hot liquids,
chemicals, electricity, lasers,
friction, and radiation. Burns may
involve the different layers of skin
and has varied effects on the skin
and may be the deeper structures.
The amount of damage will be
directly proportional to the
amount of energy released by the
energy source which will depend
upon the temperature of the
source and the duration of
contact. The higher the
temperature, greater is the degree
and depth of damage.

Burs for low speed hand pieces
are
made up of steel. These are used
to remove caries, trimming
dentures and cutting dentine.
Burs for air turbine have diamond
or tungsten carbide.

is a procedure
where coronary vessels which
have been blocked through
athermatous plaques are literally
by passed. Part of vessel is used
to connect aorta to a point beyond
occlusion in coronary vessel.
Vessel can be a vein of leg or an
internal mammary artery. It is
generally done when at least 3
vessels are blocked.

C fibers
are the fibres
which carry pain with a
speed of 2-3 m/sec.

Cachexia
refers to the
loss of anorexia due to
psychological factors.
Anxiety and depression
may cause the condition.
It may also result in lack
of nutrition. Wasting, may
develop in course of chronic
disease. General weakness is
usually associated with cancer.

generally affects
children. High fever, raised ESR
and pleural exudate is seen. Child
is hyper irritable with soft tissue
swelling and pain. There is patchy
distribution of lesion characterized
by remissions and relapses.
Marked cortical thickening of
mandible is seen.

Calcifying odontogenic cyst
is a
non aggressive cystic lesion lined
by odontogenic epithelium with
ghost cell keratinization.
Occasionally it may show
aggressive behavior. On X-ray it
appears as a well defined
intrabony lesion that can present
as unilocular or multilocular
radiolucency. It is well circumscribed.
Calcification can occur as
radiopaque areas. It is treated by
conservative surgical enucleation.

C Calcination
is a prolonged heating
of a substance below its melting
point.

Calcined

friable, dry substance by
application of heat.

Calcinosis
is the calcification in or
under skin. It is of 2 types’
calcinosis universalis and
circumscripta.

Calcitonin
is a peptide hormone
secreted by the thyroid gland. It
regulates calcium homeostasis.

Calcium homeostasis
refers to the
process where calcium participates
in neuromuscular
function, blood coagulation
membrane function and multiple
enzyme reactions. Human body
contains 25 gm/kg of lean body
mass. 90% of it is present as
calcium phosphate. Daily calcium
loss in stool is 100-200 mg
contained in intestinal secretion,
d3 helps in its absorption.

Calcium hydroxide
is a dental
material where it can be used as
cement for both direct and
indirect pulp capping and as a
protection barrier beneath
composite restoration. It can also
be used as antibacterial, root canal
medicament, root induction
material or an obturating material
for primary teeth. The material
has an alkaline pH of 11-12 and it
functions by stimulating the
formation of reparative dentin.

Calcium
plays large role in
formation of bones and teeth. In
blood it ranges from 9 to 11 mg/
dl. Low concentrations below 8
mg/dl may produce convulsions.
Daily requirement in adults is 500
mg growing child may require a
little more. Absorption is hardly
30% of its consumption. Oxalate
interferes with calcium absorption
forming calcium oxalate. Lactose
or milk sugar increases calcium.
More than 90% is in bones and
teeth. About 1 gm of calcium is
found in extra cellular fluids and
4-5 grams in soft tissues.
Calcification of deciduous teeth
begins by 20th week of fetal life.
Permanent teeth begin to calcify
when child is between 3 months
to 3 years of age. For adults
calcium/phosphorus ratio should
be 2:1. Daily requirement is 0.5
gram. Milk and dairy products
are good sources. Considerable
calcium may be lost in
preparation of vegetables if thick
skins are removed or dark green
leaves are discarded. Soyabean is
a significant source of calcium. In
children lack of calcium affects
their growth adversely.

Calculus
is an adherent calcified or
calcifying mass that forms on the
surface of natural teeth and dental
prosthesis. Ordinarily calculus
consists of mineralized bacterial
plaque. It is classified according
to its relation to the gingival
margin as supragingival and
subgingival. It consist of
inorganic matter, some water, an
organic component made up of
desquamated epithelial cells,
gram positive filamentous microorganism
such as leptotrichia,
some gram negative filamentous
forms and cocci, leucocytes and
an amorphous ground substance.
The inorganic component consists
mainly of calcium phosphate as
hydroxyapatite and other
crystalline forms of calcium
phosphate such as brushite,
whitlockite and octacalcium
phosphate. There is also a small
amount of calcium carbonate and
magnesium phosphate as well as
fluoride.

Callus
is the structure that unites
the two broken ends of the bone.
It is composed of fibrous tissue,
cartilage and bone. Internal callus
is a new bone arising from
marrow cavity while external
callus is new bone formed around
two fragments. As callus formation
progresses the cartilage cells
begin to mature. Cartilage begins
to calcify.

Calorie equivalent
is the number
of kilos calories produced per liter
of oxygen consumed.

Calories
is the form of energy
present in the body to maintain
body temperature for metabolite
purposes, to support growth and
for physical activity. One
kilocalorie is the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature
of one kilogram of water from 15°
to 16°C.

Canalicular adenoma
develops in
intraoral accessory salivary
glands and in upper lip in elderly
age group. It is a slowly growing,
well circumscribed, firm nodule
especially in lip. It is not fixed and
is composed of long strands or
cords of epithelial cells arranged
in double row. Enucleation of
lesion is the treatment of choice.

Cancer
refers to an abnormal
growth of cells that can invade
and destroy surrounding normal
tissues and sometime spreads to
other parts of the body.

is a common ailment
in wearers of full denture. It is also
common in patients wearing
orthodontic appliances or
Obturators for cleft palate. Patient
may be symptom free.

Candida hypersensitivity syndrome
is a triad of symptoms that
includes fatigue, headache/
rashes oral or vaginal infection
with candida. Nystatin therapy
generally doesn’t help.

Canine
refers to the third incisor
tooth from the midline of the oral
cavity. It has the longest crown
root with the sharp cusp which
performs the tearing action.

Canophile

grows best in the presence of
increased concentration of CO2.

Cap splints
are the silver – copper
alloy type of splints which fits on
to the tooth in a cap or crown form
along with locking plates and
connecting bars for the immobilization
of all types of jaw fractures.
The technique is time consuming
both clinically as well as in the
laboratory.

Capillary hemangiomas
are well
defined hemangiomas that
appear from bright red to purple
patches. Common sites are skin,
subcutaneous tissue and mucus
membrane of oral cavity and lips.
Hemosiderin represents the
ruptured vessels. These may also
be found in liver, bones, stomach
and small intestine.

Capillary hemorrhage
refers to the
bleeding occurring from the
capillaries. The wound bleeds
slowly. The blood is bright red in
color and oozes from many
points.

of a liquid into crevice or
tube because of capillary pressure.

Capsule
is a fibrous or membranous
connective tissue envelop.

Carbohydrate intolerance
is the
inability of the body to
completely process the nutrient
carbohydrate into a source of
energy for the body, usually
because of the deficiency of an
enzyme needed for digestion.
Lactose intolerance, the inability
to digest the sugar found in milk,
is widespread.

Carbohydrates
are the richest
source of energy. About 70-80%
of total energy is supplied by
carbohydrate. It contains carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen. Each gram
of it provides 4.1 calories
minimum of 100 grams of
carbohydrate are needed in diet.

Carbon monoxide
is a colorless,
odourless and non irritant gas
which cannot be perceived by
senses. Whenever carbon is burnt
some carbon monoxide is formed.
It is highly poisoning gas which
is absorbed through lungs.

Carbon monoxide poisoning
develops by breathing air which
is contaminated by coal gas in
badly ventilated room. Below 10-
20% concentrations will cause
lassitude, headache and shortness
of breath; 20-30% will have severe
throbbing headache, muscular
weakness, hurried respiration
and defective memory and might
faint. 30-40% concentration will
produce uncoordinated movement,
mental confusion, defective
sight and hearing. 40-50% will
result in behavior like that of a
drunken person and loss of
power. Increasing confusion and
hallucination will also develop.
50-60% concentration results in
comma followed by convulsions.
Skin will become pink. 60-70%
will result in deep coma.
Incontinence of urine and feces
will develop. 70-80% concentration
will result in quick death.

Carbon steel
refers to an alloy of
carbon and iron with less than 2%
carbon present.

Carbuncle
is a lesion where there
is swelling of short duration. It is
present commonly on the neck. It
may be bluish red in color. There
are multiple openings with pus
giving a sieve like appearance. It
is diffuse and tender and can be
commonly seen in diabetic
patient.

Carcinoma in situ
is a premalignant
condition where it is very difficult
to differentiate it from dysplasia.
There is no individual cell
keratinization, no epithelial pearl
formation and no hyperkeratosis.
Lesions may be flat, red, velvety
and granular to look. Lesions of
carcinoma in situ are to be treated
vigorously with local excision.
Wider surrounding area should
also be removed but regional
nodes are generally not removed.
Majority of these lesions occur in
floor of mouth.

Carcinoma of buccal mucosa
refers
to the malignant ulcer affecting
buccal mucosa. Chewing of tobacco
is commonly involved. Verrucous
carcinoma develops in
case of chewing tobacco. Leukoplakia
is a common predecessor of
it. Cheek biting and dental irritation
from jagged teeth may rarely
cause it. Lesion is painful ulceration.
Superficial lesions may
grow outwards. Incidence of metastases
is high. Maxillary lymph
glands are commonly involved.

Carcinoma of floor of mouth
refers
to the lesion affecting floor of the
mouth. Smoking pipe or cigar is
the main etiology. Generally there
is indurated ulcer of varying size
situated on one side of mid line.
It may be painful. Carcinoma may
invade deeper structure and may
involve sub maxillary or
sublingual gland. Involvement of
tongue results in slurring of
speech. Metastases spread to sub
maxillary group of lymph nodes.
Even small tumors recur after
surgical excision, otherwise
prognosis is fair.

Carcinoma of gingiva
generally
develops after extraction of tooth.
Carcinoma initiates as ulceration,
purely erosive lesion. Fixed gingiva
is more commonly involved. It
generally involves maxilla.
Mandibular gingiva metastasis
occurs more than maxillary
gingiva. Metastasis is a common
sequel of gingival carcinoma.
Prognosis is not very good.

Carcinoma of lip
refers to the malignant
lesion occurring on the lip.
Pipe smokers are commonly involved.
It involved vermillion border
of lip of one side. It starts as
area of thickening, indurations and
irregular ulceration. Later it may
produce an exophytic proliferative
growth. Carcinoma is slow to metastasize.
Sub mental and sub maxillary
nodes of same side are involved.
Surgical excision followed
by radiotherapy may help.

Carcinoma of maxillary sinus
is
often hopelessly advanced before
patient comes to know about it.
There is development of swelling
and bulging of alveolar ridge,
mucobuccal fold and elongation
of maxillary molars. Patient
complaints of unilateral nasal
stiffness along with discharge.
Various walls of antrum may be
involved. Ulceration into oral
cavity may develop. Metastasis
generally doesn’t occur.

Carcinoma of palate
is poorly
defined, ulcerated painful lesion
on one side of midline. It may
invade bone and nasal cavity.
Metastasis to regional lymph
nodes is common. As treatment
both surgery and radiotherapy
has been used.

Carcinoma of pancreas
occurs most
commonly in 50-60 years of age.
Tumors of head of pancreas
present with weight loss,
obstructive jaundice and gastric
pain. When mass is palpable
surgery loses its use. Liver is
enlarged. Gall bladder is
palpable. Elevated alkaline
phosphatase and bilirubin reflect
common duct obstruction or
hepatic metastasis. Carcinoma of
distal common bile duct present
with weight loss, obstructive
jaundice and palpable gall
bladder.

Carcinoma of tongue
is common
carcinoma of oral cavity. Leukoplakia
may predispose it. There
is formation of painless mass or
ulcer. Pain develops on infection.
There may be development of
exophytic mass or to infiltrate
deep layers of tongue. It results
in indurations and fixation. It develops
on lateral border or ventral
surface of tongue. Treatment
is complicated and prognosis is
not good.

Carcinoma stomach
may be
associated with H-pylori.
Adenocarcinoma comprises 95%
of cases with variable degree of
differentiation. Polypoid type is
well differentiated (see Figure on
page 77).

Cardiac arrest
is the most serious
complication of collapse followed
after angina or myocardial
infarction. Signs of cardiac arrest
include sudden unconsciousness,
absence of breathing and pulse
and dilated pupils.

Cardiac impulse
is an action
potential that occurs in the cardiac
conduction tissue.

Cardiac muscle
is found in heart.
Like skeletal muscle cardiac
muscle is striated. Cardiac muscle
cells are long branching cells
and fit tight. These tight fitting
junctions promote rapid conduction
of electrical signals throughout
heart. Cardiac muscle is not
under voluntary control.

Cardiac edema
refers to the right
ventricle failure. Edema is
systemic in distribution in all
tissues and organs. In left
ventricle failure the lungs are
primarily affected. Edema is in
lungs. Cardiac edema is a
generalized edema.

Cardinal leprosy
includes hypopigmented
skin lesions with loss
of sensation or absence of
sweating. Nerve involvement is
manifested by nerve thickening
and/or tenderness. Skin smear
may be positive for M leprae.
When the skin smear is negative
presence of other 2 cardinal sign
is sufficient to make a diagnosis
of leprosy.

Cardiogenic shock
occurs when
the systolic BP falls to less than 80
mm Hg or 30 mm Hg less than
base line. It will result in narrowed
pulse pressure. There may
be rapid, weak and occasionally
irregular pulse. Peripheral vasoconstriction
causes cyanosis of
extremities giving pale, cool and
clammy skin. Person may become
restless and anxious. Oliguria and
confusion develops.

Cardiomyopathy
is a group of
disease involving primarily the
heart muscle.

Cardiospasm
refers to the weak or
peristalsis through lower oesophagus
and failure of relaxation

develops gradual or sudden onset
of dysphagia. To start with
food regurgitates and later on
when dilatation of esophagus
takes place food accumulates.
Pain is relieved by drinking cold
water. Endoscopy shows chronically
inflamed mucosa.

Caries activity test
is a quick test
that provides information about
acid forming microorganisms or
their activity in mouth.

Caries severity index
was developed
by Tank Certrude and
Storvick Clara in 1960. This index
was developed to study the depth
and extent of the caries surfaces
and the extent of pulpal involvements.
The progress of the dental
caries in stages as described by
Massler and Schour in 1952, were
modified and this caries severity
index was devised to measure the
extent and depth of decayed surfaces
and pulpal involvements
based on clinical and radiographic
examinations.

Caries susceptibility index
developed
by Richardson in 1961, for
assessing caries susceptibility.
This index is based on Bodecker
and Mellanby caries indices.
There are 2 factors involved in
measuring caries susceptibility
using the dynamic survey
namely: a. Amount of tooth surfaces
at risk, b. Amount of caries
developing during the period of
observation. ‘B’ divided by ‘a’ will
give a measure of susceptibility.

Caring skills
are the nursing skills
to maintain patient’s health.

Cariogram
is a new method of illustrating
an interaction of factors
contributing to the development
of caries has been introduced by
Bratthall et al., (1999) called
cariogram. A pie circle diagram
is divided into 5 sectors in the following
colors. Green - shows and
estimation of the chance to avoid
caries. Dark blue–‘diet’ is based
on a combination of diet contents
and diet frequency. Red-bacteria
are based on a combination of
amount of plaque and mutants
streptococci. Light blue sector –
‘susceptibility’ is based on a combination
of fluoride program,
saliva secretion and salivary
buffering capacity. Yellow sector–
‘circumstances’ is based on a combination
of past caries experience
and related disease.

is a firm, elastic, flexible
connective tissue that is attached
to articulate bone surfaces
forming certain part of skeleton.

Hyaline casts appear as clear
cylinders in febrile illness. Red
cell casts are RBCs seen in
subacute glomerulonephritis.
White cell casts are hyaline casts
with WBCs seen in chronic
pyelonephritis. Epithelial cell
casts is seen in tubular necrosis
while granular cast is seen in
chronic glomerulonephritis.

non experimental research in
which assignment to groups is
based on pre existing characteristic
or attributes of subjects.

tomography.

Catabolism
is a metabolic breakdown
of complex molecules into
simpler molecules. There is the
breakdown of food compounds
or cytoplasm into simpler compound.
Process releases energy.

Catalyst

up reactions without being
changed. When proteins play a
role of catalysts these are known
as enzymes.

motor anesthesia with incontinence
or urinary retention.
Symptoms include low back pain,
incontinence of urine and bilateral
sciatica. Person may develop fecal
retention and saddle anesthesia.

Causalgia
is an unpleasant burning
type of continuous pain following
peripheral nerve injuries. It is
more common in hand and arm.
Skin of the affected area has
spontaneous pain and perspires
excessively. Patient will not allow
skin to be touched.

Cauterize
is to burn, corrode or
destroy living tissue by means of
caustic soda, heated metal or
electric current.

Cavitation
is a carious process
occuring in a tooth resulting in a
cavity or a ditch. It appears as
radiolucent lesion on radiograph.

Cavity liners
are liquid
suspensions of zinc oxide or
calcium hydroxide. It can be
applied in a thin film to the
surface of cavity. Cavity liners
neutralize the free acid of zinc
phosphate and silicate cements.

Cavity preparation
is a mechanical
alteration of defective, injured or
diseased tooth in order to best
receive a restorative material
which will reestablish a healthy
state for the tooth including
esthetic correction where
indicated, along with normal
form and function.

Cavity primers
are used to increase
the adaptation of methylmethacrylate
filling materials to cavity
walls. It seals the margins.

Cavity varnishes
are solutions of
one or more resins from natural
gums, synthetic resins. It reduces
postoperative sensitivity by
sealing the open ends of dentin
tubules with a glaze like covering
but being thin it is insufficient to
provide thermal insulation.
Varnishes check the microleakage
of fluids around the margins of
restorations.

Cavosurface margin
is the contact
between the cavity surface the
tooth surface location where the
walls and line angles meet the
unaltered tooth surface (see
Figure).

CCD technology
is usually made of
a chip of pure covalently bonded
silicon atoms. When the chip is
exposed to visible light or X-ray
radiation, bonds are broken, and
charged electron hole pairs are
formed. The electrical charge
created is captured, amplified,
converted, and displayed as an
image.

Cd4 (helper t-cells)
promote
proliferation, maturation and
immunologic function of other
cell types.

Cd44
are the hematopoietic
progenitor cells express the most
truncated form of cd44, which
bind hyaluronic acid a gag found
in ecm. Therefore, a wide variety
of adhesive interactions between
cell – cell and cell - ecm are critical
for hematopoiesis.

Cd8 (cytotoxic t-cells)
are those cells
that has an ability to kill cells and
that have foreign molecules on
their surface.

Cell mediated immunity
is a
resistance to disease organisms
resulting from the actions of cells
specially sensitized ‘t’ cells.

Cell-poor zone (Cell-free zone of Weil)
is located immediately
subjacent to the odontoblast layer,
which is 40 mm in width and is
relatively free of cells. It is
traversed by capillaries and
unmyelinated nerve fibres. This
zone may be or may not be
apparent in young pulps, where
dentin forms rapidly or in older
pulps, where reparative dentin is
being produced.

Cell-rich zone of pulp
is located
immediately subjacent to the cellpoor
zone. It is much prominent
in the coronal pulp than in the
radicular pulp. This zone is richly
populated with fibroblasts, along
with macrophages dendritic cells
and lymphocytes. It forms as a
result of peripheral migration of
cells populating the central
regions of the pulp, commencing
at the time of tooth eruption.
Although cell division within the
cell-rich zone is a rare occurrence
in normal pulps, death of
odontoblasts causes a greater
increase in the rate of mitosis. It
acts as a reservoir for the replacement
of irreversibly damaged
odontoblasts.

Cellulitis
refers to an inflammation
of soft tissues. It is a local pain and
swelling of acute onset with
pyrexia and general debility.
Streptococci are particularly
potent producing hyalurodinase
and causing cellulitis. Cellulitis of
face and neck develops mostly
due to dental infection. Person is
ill with fever and increased WBC
count. There is painful swelling
of soft tissue. Its boundaries are
not very well defined. Skin is of
pinkish color and lymph glands
are enlarged. Cellulitis is treated
by antibiotics. Infection of sublingual
space produces swelling of
floor of mouth.

Cement base
is a layer of cement
commonly used beneath a
permanent dental restoration
with purpose to encourage
recovery of injured pulp or
otherwise protect pulp against
thermal injury. Better cement base
is zinc oxide eugenol and calcium
hydroxide. Glass ionomer cement
is polycrylate based and have
anticariogenic properties.

Cement sealer
is a compound used
in filling of a root canal. It is put
in plastic form which solidifies
after placement. It fills the
irregularities of canal.

Cementation
is the process where
the appliance is glued on to the
associated area with the help of
cement.

Cementicles
are small foci of
calcified tissue not necessarily
true cementum. It lies free on
periodontal ligament. These are
developed by calcification of
nests of epithelial cells. The
pattern of calcification gives
appearance of a circular lamellated
structure. Cementicles may
arise from focal calcification of
connective tissue sometimes
calcification occurs as small,
round or ovoid globules of calcium
salt. Cementicles are of no
clinical significance.

Cementoenamel junction (CEJ)
is
the line around the visible surface
of teeth where the cementum and
enamel meet. Actually it is also
known as neck or cervix of tooth.

Cementum
is the bone like
structure which covers the root.
The main function of cementum
is to provide attachment of the
tooth to alveolar bone. Union of
cementum and dentin is known as
dentino-cemental junction. Like
dentin, cementum also shows
continuous growth. Junction
between the enamel and cementum
is called Cemento-enamel junction.
Cementum has the same hardness
that of bone. Composition - 50% of
inorganic substance, 50% of organic
and water.

Cemento ossifying fibroma
It is
uncommon and is well
circumscribed and undergoes
slow expansile growth usually in
mandibular or molar region. It
causes painless swelling between
20-40 years. It is radiolucent with
varying degree of calcification in
center. Roots of related tooth can
be displaced. It may have a
definable capsule so can easily be
enucleated.

Center of gravity
is the center of
one’s weight, half above and half
below. Similarly it is half on left
and half on right.

Central buttressing bone formation
is the process of compensatory
bone formation occurring within
the jaw in an attempt to buttress
bony trabaculae which is
weakened by bone resorption.

Central cementifying fibroma
is a
neoplasm of bone and may
develop at any age. Mandible is
more affected. Radiographically
one can notice radiolucent area
with no radio-opacities. It is
composed of delicate interlacing
collagen fibres arranged in
discrete bundles. Mitotic figures
may be present in small number.
It has to be excised carefully.

Central giant cell granuloma
is a
benign intra osseous destructive
giant cell lesion. Generally
anterior part of jaw bone is
affected. It is a reactive lesion. It
affects mandible more than
maxilla. Some lesions may cross
the mid line. It is a small, slow
enlarging, bony hard swelling of
jaw. Lesion may cause perforation
of cortical plate. Teeth in
affected region are always vital.
Radiographically lesion will slow
multilocular radiolucent area in
jaw and it gives a soap bubble
appearance. When unilocular it
will show a drop shaped appearance.
Histologically central giant
cell granuloma shows multinucleated
giant cells. Several
areas of hemorrhage and hemosiderin
pigmentation are also
seen. Around these blood capillaries
are also found.

Central incisors
are used for
cutting or biting food, these are
the first of the four anterior teeth
of either jaw.

Central nervous system
includes
brain and spinal cord.

Central ossifying fibroma
represents
a well demarcated
expansile jaw lesion. It is well
encapsulated. Children and
young adults are affected. There
is usually a single lesion. There is
localized painless non tendered
bony hard swelling in jaw.
Tumour is slow growing but may
disfigure the face. In some cases
displacement of teeth may be seen
due to expansion and distortion
of cortical plates. Histopathologically
highly cellular fibroblastic
stroma with ‘whorled pattern’
collagen fibres may be noted.

Central ossifying fibroma
may
occur at any age. There is
predilection for mandible. Until
swelling develops symptom
doesn’t develop. Displacement of
teeth may be one of the early
feature. It is slow growing. Lesion
contains delicate interlacing
collagen fibres. Mitotic figures
may be present.

Central ray
is the central portion of
the primary beam of radiation.

Centric occlusion
is the
relationship of the occlusal
surfaces of one arch to those in the
opposing arch at physical rest
position.

Centric occlusion
refers to the
closing of jaws in a position that
produces maximum stable
contact between the occluding
surfaces of the maxillary and
mandibular teeth.

Centric relation
is the relationship
of the maxillary arch to the
mandibular arch when the
condyle is in its most retracted
position.

Centric relation
refers to the most
cranial position of the mandible
along the retruded path of closure.

Cephalic vein
One of the four
superficial veins of upper limb.

Cephalocaudal gradient of growth
is an axis of increased growth
extending from head towards the
feet. In the fetal life, at about the
third month, the head takes up
almost 50% of total body length.
At this stage, cranium is large
relative to the face and represents
more than half of total head. In
contrast, limbs are still
rudimentary and the trunk is
underdeveloped. By the time of
birth the trunk and limbs are
grown faster than head and face
so that the proportion of entire
body devoted to head has
decreased about 30%. The overall
pattern of growth, there after
follows this course with
progressive reduction of relative
size of the head to about 12% of
an adult.

Cephalometric film
is an extraoral
X-ray film used to view bony and
soft tissue areas of facial profile.

Cephalometric technique
has
contributed significantly to the
knowledge of human craniofacial
skeletal growth. Cephalometry
makes it possible to take
serial radiographs of a patient’s
skull in order to study the growth
changes taking place.

Cephalosporin
is a bactericidal
drug which contains a betalactam
ring. These are broadspectrum
antibiotics. There are
many different cephalosporins
with varying side chains; these
side chains alter the pharmacokinetics,
spectrum of activity and
beta - lactamase resistance.
Cephalosporin’s are relatively
expensive and, although a good
alternative to penicillin’s when a
broad-spectrum drug is required,
but should not be used as first
choice unless the organism is
known to be sensitive. Cephalosporin’s
also contains a betalactam
ring and are bactericidal.
They are broad-spectrum antibiotics.
There are many different
cephalosporins with varying side
chains; these side chains alter the
pharmacokinetics, spectrum of
activity and beta- lactamase resistance.
Cephalosporin’s are relatively
expensive and, although a
good alternative to penicillin’s
when a broad-spectrum drug is
required, should not be used as
first choice unless the organism is
known to be sensitive.

Ceramic
is a compound of metallic
and non metallic elements. Dental
gypsum, zinc phosphate and
porcelains are example of ceramic
material. Ceramics are fully
oxidized materials and therefore
chemically stable. So these don’t
elicit adverse biological response.
Metal they do oxidize. Two types
of ‘inert’ ceramics of interest are
carbon and alumina.

Cerebellar ataxia
appears in
druken patient. Patient walks on
a broad base, feet are planted
wide apart and placed irregularly.
Ataxia is severe in open as
well as with closed eyes.

Cerebellar gait
The main feature of
this gait is wide base, unsteadiness
and irregularity of steps. On
getting up from chair irregular of
swaying of trunk takes place.
Standing heel to toe in a straight
line is difficult. With lesions of
thalamus and midbrain ataxic
signs on opposite side develop. It
is common in alcoholics, long
term dilantin intake and multiple
sclerosis. In children tuberculoma
may present it.

Cerebellum
is a part of the brain
that is located in posterior fossa
and is separated by tentorium
cerebella. It comprises median
vermis and two lateral cerebellar
hemispheres. It is comprised by
a layer of cortex and an internal
mass of white matter in which
cerebellar nuclei are located. The
lesion of flocculonodular lobe
causes trunk ataxia, swaying and
staggering. Paleocerebellum
controls antigravity muscles.
Neocerebellum controls fine coordinated
movements of hands.
Extensive lesion of anterior lobe
causes hypotonia, postural
abnormalities, ataxia and mild
weakness of ipsilateral arm and
leg. Hypotonia is more apparent
with acute lesions.

Cerebral compression
is a
condition that occurs after head
injury. Patient becomes restless
and passes into coma. His face
becomes flushed and pulse
becomes slow. On paralysed side
temperature will be more. Pupil
on the side of lesion dilates after
initial contraction. In last stage
both the pupils dilate and become
fixed.

Cerebral edema
The normal water
of grey matter is 80% and of white
matter 60% of weight. Brain may
also swell due to increase in
cerebral volume known as
congestive brain swelling.

Cerebral infarction
is a disease
where contralateral athetosis is
accompanied by altered level of
consciousness. There may be
paralysis of face/limbs of
opposite side.

Cerebral ischemia
occurs due to
deficient supply of glucose to the
blood. Usually brain derives the
energy from oxidative metabolism
of glucose. In brain there
is no glucose store. Once the CBF
(cerebral blood flow) falls below
20 ml/100 gram of brain/minute
EEG becomes flat and evoked
response disappears signifying
the starving neurones. CBF below
10 ml/100 gram of brain tissue
per minute leads to infarction and
restoration of circulation is of no
value as pet shows complete
cessation of glucose metabolism.
Around the infracted zone, there
is potentially viable zone of brain
tissue where blood flow is low,
function is depressed but
recovery is possible. Vasogenic
edema starts due to dilation of
vessels in infarcted zone. Edema
stays maximum by 2-4 days and
then subsides.

Cerebral malaria
is caused with
falciparum infection. Multiple
petechial hemorrhages are
responsible for CNS symptoms.
High fever may be followed by
convulsions or unconsciousness.
Sensory motor deficits and
mental symptoms may occur.
Parasite may be recovered from
peripheral blood. Mortality is
20-40%. It is a medical emergency.
Quinine hydrochloride 600 mg in
5% dextrose is given IV. Oral
quinine 350 mg 2 tablets three
times a day along with
tetracycline is given. Plenty of IV.
Glucose is necessary.

Cerebral nuclei
are islands of gray
matter located in cerebral cortex
which are responsible for
automatic movements and
postures. These are known as
basal ganglion.

Cerebral venous thrombosis
may
develop after pyogenic meningitis,
collagen disease, and trauma
when superior sagittal is involved
it may cause papilloedoma and
hemorrhagic infarction. Patient
may develop papilloedema, extensive
bilateral hemorrhagic infarction
not confirming to any
specific vascular territory. Headache
and seizure may develop.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Near
about 500 ml of it is produced
daily from choroid plexuses of
3rd, 4th and lateral ventricles. It
is clear and colorless with slightly
opaque hue due to globulin.
Specific gravity ranges from
1003-1009.

Cerebrospinal rhinorrhea
refers to
the escape of cerebrospinal fluid
in to the nasal cavity due to
communication of ethmoidal
bone which occurs due to lefort
II and lefort III fractures and the
fracture involving nasal complex,
which may lead to a dural tear in
the region of cribriform plate of
ethmoidal bone.

Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
is
a focal neurologic disorder
caused by destruction of brain
substance as a result of intracerebral
hemorrhage, thrombosis,
embolism or vascular insufficiency.
CVA also known as
stroke, cerebral apoplexy and
brain attack. There are 2 major
classes of stroke, hemorrhagic
and occlusive. The most prevalent
form is the occlusive stroke that
commonly results from atherosclerotic
disease and cardiac
abnormalities. Thrombosis of intracranial
and extra cranial arteries
and cerebral embolisation
from various origins throughout
the body are the primary causes
of cerebral infarction. Thrombus
formation is more likely to occur
in other atherosclerotic vessels.
Cerebral embolisation is also a
causative factor. A major source
of emboli is in the heart of individuals
with impaired flow or damaged
valves–rheumatic heart disease
with mitral stenosis and atrial
fibrillation is most common case.

Cervical
refers to the neck of a
tooth (see Figure on page 89).

is
the compression of cervical
nerves supplying upper arm
produces chronic arm and neck
pain. Prolonged sitting worsen
the pain. There will be muscle
weakness, paresthesia and
decreased reflex response.

Cervical radiculopathy
In Latin,
radicutus refers to ‘by the roots’
and when root of nerve is pinched
it is called radiculopathy. It causes
numbness, and or weakness in
arm. Common causes of pinched
nerves are calcium deposits from
arthritis or herniated disc.

Cervical rib
is a congenital
disorder. Lowest cervical
vertebra is over developed to
form a rib. It may be partially or
completely developed. It may be
symptom free or may cause
numbness and tingling.

Cervical spine disc herniation
Symptoms include neck pain
which may radiate to scalp,
shoulder or to extremity certain
position may increase the
symptoms. One may develop
numbness in distal upper
extremity. It may result in
fasiculations, loss of deep tendon
reflex and atrophy of muscles.

Cervicogenic headache
describes
head pain and occurs as an
abnormality in neck. The work
genesis means ‘to come pain’. So
cervicogenic literally means pain
coming from neck area. Generally
headache is experienced as pain
in neck on one side. Certain neck
movements may relieve pain.

Cervix
is the area that refers to the
neck of the tooth; the area where
the crown joins the root or the
enamel joins the cementum.

Characteristics of lymph node enlargement
is of diagnostic
valve. In tuberculosis nodes are
matted due to periadenitis.
Infected nodes are tender and
firm. Lymphomas produce
symmetrical large, firm and
rubbery nodes. These are
movable, discrete and non tender.
In metastasis one finds fixed,
stony hard, localized glands. In
children due to throat infection
cervical glands are enlarged.
Bilateral cervical glands are
enlarged in tuberculosis,
lymphoma, and leukemias.
Nodes in Hodgkin’s disease are
rubbery, discrete and mobile.

Charcot’s joint
is more frequently
seen in diabetic neuropathy,
syringomyelia, spinal cord injury,
leprosy and peripheral nerve
injury. Prolonged administration
of hydrocortisone in bone may
cause it charcoal joint. Normal
muscle tone and protective
reflexes are lost. It is a painless
joint with extensive cartilage
erosion.

Charter’s tooth brushing
is a
method designed to increase
cleaning effectiveness and
gingival stimulation in the
interproximal areas. Bristles are
pointed toward the crown of the
tooth rather than apically. Tooth
brush is positioned horizontally
and parallel with the arch in all
areas except the lingual area of
anterior teeth and the occlusal
surfaces. Bristles are placed at
gingival margin. These are
directed toward the occlusal
surface at a 450 angle to the long
axis of tooth. Back and forth
motion is used for activation. It is
good for patients with orthodontic
brackets.

Cheatle forceps
is a heavy stainless
steel forceps without locking
system. It is used to hold sterilized
items like bandage, gauze and
gloves. It is kept in bottle dipped
in savlon solution.

Chediak–Higashi syndrome
is an
uncommon genetic disease and is
fatal in early life. It is transmitted
as an autosomal recessive trait.
There may be photophobia;
nystagmus and albinism. Oral
lesions include glossitis, gingivitis
and ulceration of oral mucosa.
Blood shows giant abnormal
granules in peripheral circulating
leukocytes. There is no specific
treatment. Defect is of granule
containing cells as granulocytes
and melanocytes. Hypo pigmentation
will be seen in skin and
hair. Some may develop
neuropathy. Child dies before the
age of 10 due to recurrent
infection. Lymph nodes. spleen,
liver and bone marrow are
infiltrated with lymphohistiocyte
cell. Gingival and periodontal
findings are common. Early loss
of teeth is noted.

Cheek pouch
is the area of the
mouth inside the cheek.

Cheilitis granulomatosa
develops
as a persistent swelling of a lip,
facial nerve palsy and fissured
tongue. Cause is unknown.

Chelation
refers to the decalcification
and removal of tooth
surface of the lips and angles of
mouth.

Chelitis glandularis
is a condition
where lower lip becomes
enlarged, firm and finally
everted. Cause is unknown.
Labial salivary glands are
enlarged. They may become
nodular. Orifices of secretary
ducts are inflamed and red. These
are of three types, simple type,
superficial suppurative type and
deep suppurative type. Simple
type is multiple, pin head size
lesion. Central part is depressed.
Superficial suppurative type is
having painless, induration and
crusting ulcerations.

Chemical burn
The gingival becomes
white and necrotic following
injudicious use of caustic agent.

Chemical cure
is a method where
the restorative material bonds to
the tooth by the means of
chemical. It gives good esthetics,
more complete cure and curing
light is not needed. Disadvantage
of it is more porosity, poor color
stability and less working time
available. Light cure gives better
color quality.

Chemical diabetes
refers to the
asymptomatic diabetes mellitus
without any symptoms.

Chemical name
refers to the name
by which a chemist knows the
drug.

Chemical reaction
is a process
where atoms of molecules or
compounds interact to form new
chemical combination e.g.
Glucose interacts with oxygen to
form CO2, water and energy.

Chemical sterilization
is a process
where combination of formaldehyde,
alcohol, acetone, ketone
and steam serves as an effective
sterilizing agent. Microbial destruction
results from dual action
of toxic chemicals and heat.

Chemical test of opium
is called
marquis test. If the suspect reside
is treated with a mixture of 3 c.c.
of concentrated sulphuric acid
and 3 drops of formalin, it
produces purple color changing
to violet and finally to blue color.

Chemical theory given by Parmly (1819)
rebelled against the vital
theory and proposed that an
unidentified “chemical” agent
was responsible for caries.
Support for the chemical theory
came from Robertson (1835) and
Regnart (1938) who actually
carried out experiments with
different dilutions of organic
acids (such as sulphuric and
nitric) and found that they
corroded enamel and dentin. He
stated that caries began on the
enamel surface in locations where
the food putrefied and acquired
sufficient dissolving power to
produce the disease chemically.

Chemiclave
is a heat sterilizer that
uses heat, chemical vapor and
pressure to achieve sterilization.

Chemo–parasitic theory
is a blend
of the above two theories, because
it states that caries is caused by
acids produced by microorganisms
of the mouth. In a series
of experiments Miller demonstrated
the following facts, acid
was present within the deeper
carious lesions, as shown by reaction
on litmus paper. Different
kinds of foods (bread, sugar, but
not meat) mixed with saliva and
incubated at 37degree centigrade
could decalcify the entire crown
of a tooth. Several types of mouth
bacteria (at least 30 species where
isolated) could produce enough
acid to cause dental caries. Lactic
acid was an identifiable product
in carbohydrate –saliva incubation
mixtures. Different microorganisms
(filamentous, long and
short bacilli and micrococcus) invade
carious dentin. Miller concluded
that no single species of
microorganism caused caries but
the process was mediated by an
oral microorganism capable of
producing acid and digesting
protein.

Chemoreceptors
are the receptors
that respond to chemicals and are
responsible for taste and smell.

Chemotaxis
is a process in which
substance attracts cells or
organism in its vicinity.

Chemotherapeutic agent
is a term
used for a chemical substance that
provides a therapeutic benefit.

Chemotherapeutic index
is the
ratio of minimal effective dose to
the minimal tolerated dose.

Chemotherapeutic
is an agent of a
chemical nature which exerts an
antimicrobial effect.

Cherubism
is an uncommon
disease involving teeth. It appears
at the age of three. It generally
develops bilaterally. Mostly
mandible is involved. Deciduous
teeth shed suddenly at the age of
three. Permanent dentition is
defective with the absence of
numerous teeth. Oral mucosa
remains normal. Some teeth look
like floating in cyst like space.

Chest pain
The most common cause
in winter is fibrostitis. Chest pain
may be caused by pleurisy and
pneumonia. Most prominent is
the pain of angina and myocardial
infarction. Myocardial pain
may be referred to arm. Pain of
pericarditis is felt in center. In
some cases anxiety and stress may
also cause chest pain.

similar to herpes virus. Incubation
period is 14 days. Prodromal
symptoms include headache,
nasopharyngitis followed by
maculo papular or vesicular
eruptions. Eruptions start on
trunk and spreads to involve face
and extremities. Small blisters
develop on oral mucosa. Tongue,
gingiva and palate may be involved.
These rupture soon and
ulcer develops. Complications are
not common and mortality rate is
low.

Chief complaint
is complaint
recorded by a medical professional
in patients own words.

Child psychology
is the science
that deals with the mental power
(or) an interaction between the
conscious and subconscious
element in a child.

Childhood
is the period an from 15
months until 12-13 years. During
early childhood there is active ossification,
but the child grows older,
the rate of growth slows down.

Chills
are extreme, involuntary
muscle contractions. There may
be violent shivering and teeth
shattering. There may be fever,
pneumonia produces a single chill
and malaria produces a recurring
chill with high fever. Chill can be
produced by transfusion reactions
and exposure to cold. Certain drugs
may also cause it.

Chime

0.012%with a broad antimicrobial
spectrum. It acts by binding to the
hydroxyl apatite of enamel, the
pellicle, the bacteria, extracellular
polysaccharides and the mucous
membrane owing to its cationic
nature. After binding, the agent
is slowly released in an active
form over a 12-24 hour period.
This property of chlorhexidine is
an attribute to its substantiality.
It can be delivered as a rinse, a
syringe for subgingival application
and incorporated in chewing
gum. Disadvantages include
brownish–black discoloration of
the teeth, restorations and tongue,
temporary aberration of taste sensation
(dysgeusia), burning lips
and mucous membrane discoloration.

stains caused by prolong use of a
mouth wash containing chlorhexidine.

Chloride compounds
are oxidizing
agents and end products are
inactive chlorides. Strong
hypochlorite solutions have a
penetrating and irritating odor
due to release of chlorine gas. It
may corrode metals.

Chloride shift

quantities may lead to convulsions.
In reference to dentistry,
chlorine is a potent germicide
widely used as disinfectant of
water. Sodium hypochlorite in

hormone secreted by intestinal
mucosa. It regulates several
gastrointestinal activities
including motility.

Cholera
is caused by coma shaped
actively motile flagellated gram
negative bacillus vibrio cholera.
The bacilli proliferate in small intestine
without invasion producing
a potent protein. Incubation
period varies from a few hours to
6 days. Disease has 2 phases.
Evacuation phase is of acute,
painless profuse diarrhea with
vomiting. Stool is rice watery
odourless. In collapse phase there
develops cold clammy skin, hypotension
and tachycardia. Patient
becomes dull and apathetic,
prompt rehydration is the only
remedy. Chemoprophylaxis with
500 mg helps.

Cholesterol
is present as free sterol
in most tissues except for adrenal
cortex, plasma and
athermatous plaques. Most of the
tissues are capable of synthesizing
cholesterol; most of plasma
cholesterol originates from liver
and distal small intestine. Increase
in ldl and decrease in HDL cholesterol
are related to atherosclerosis
in dependently.

increased amount of cholesterol
in blood, more than 225 mg %.

Choline

painless swelling of jaw. Later on
it becomes painful and tender. It
is very fast enlarging causing
severe expansion. Radiologically it
shows moth eaten radiolucent area
in bone with ill defined borders.
Blotchy areas of radiopacities are
also found. Even wide surgical
excision gives poor prognosis.

non repetitive irregular
arrhythmic that can affect any
part of body but are more
pronounced in digits, unpredictable
burst of rapid jerky
movements. But these movements
remain purposeful. It can

in children. Patient complains of
pain in tooth and jaw. Radiograph
will show caries tooth against
bony mass. X-ray shows focal

that results due to excessive
alcohol consumption. There is
deposition of protein plugs
within pancreatic ducts. Chronic
pancreatitis is not reversible. Only
it can be arrested. There will be a
chronic pain radiating to back. It
is deep seated and antacids don’t
give any relief. Protein plugs
calcify to give pancreatic calcification.
Pain is to be controlled and
surgical resection may be needed.

Chronic periodontitis/adult periodontitis/chronic adult periodontitis
is a slowly
progressing disease and is
defined as an infectious disease
resulting in inflammation within
the supporting tissues of the teeth,
progressive attachment loss and
bone loss. Clinically supragingival
and subgingival plaque

is frequently associated with
calculus formation, gingivitis,
pocket formation, loss of
periodontal attachment and
alveolar bone. Loss of stippling
along with spontaneous bleeding
and suppuration can be
appreciated.

Chronic pulpalgia
refers to the
pain of pulpal origin. The pain is
diffuse and patient may not be
able to locate the site of pain. The
pulp involved is not affected by
cold. Pain persists till irritant is
there. These are the lesions which
cause pain until irritant is
dislodged. Radiograph often
reveals interproximal or root
caries or recurrent caries under a
restoration. The apices of
involved roots also show external
resorption. Thermal tests are of
little value in a positive sense.
Pulp extirpation and endodontic
therapy if the tooth is to be saved,
otherwise extraction is the line of
treatment.

is a pain of pulpal
origin where pain is not an
important feature of chronic

without pain. There is infiltration
of pulp tissue by varying number
of mononuclear cells specially
lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Chronic pyelonephritis
is a chronic
tubulointestinal disease resulting
from repeated attacks of inflammation
and scarring with
pelvicalyceal damage. Most of
patients develop hypertension.

scarred. Involvement is symmetrical
in both kidneys.
Hallmark of disease is coarse,
discrete large scars with flat
surface. Pelvic and calyceal walls
are thickened and distorted mucosa
becomes granular or atrophic.

Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis
is
a chronic inflammation of salivary
gland tissue. It results in
degeneration and subsequent
replacement of acini by fibrous
tissue. Trauma, infection and
autoimmune all may cause it.
Major or minor gland all may be
affected. Affected gland is
enlarged and remains freely
movable. More the fibrosis
develops more the firm it
becomes. Once the acini are lost
the gland parenchyma undergoes
progressive sclerosis. Then
sialodectomy has to be done.

surfaces of anterior and posterior
teeth – can occur on either the facial
or the lingual surfaces; however the
predominant occurrence of these
lesions is adjacent to the lip and
cheeks rather than tongue.

Classical conditioning
is a behavioral
theory put forward by a
Russian physiologist. Ivan Pavlov
in 19th century. During his studies
of reflexes that apparently
unassociated stimulus could produce
reflexive behavior. Pavlov’s
classic experiment involves a
presentation of food to a hungry
animal, along with some other
stimulus like ringing of a bell. The
sight with sound of food elicits the
salivation by reflex mechanism. If
a bell is rung every time the auditory
stimulus is associated with
food presentation stimulus. In
short time, the ringing of a bell by
itself will elicit salivation. Classical
conditioning then operates by
the simple process of association
of one stimulus with another. It
is unusual for child to see a people
with white coat if the unconditioned
stimulus of painful treatment
comes to be associated with
conditioned stimulus of white
coat, a child may cry withdraw
immediately of first sight of white
coat. Later on child learns to associate
these stimuli on seeing
white coat is enough to produce
a pain.

Classical migraine
is described as
periodic headache, usually
unilateral in onset but which later
on becomes generalized. It is
associated with nausea, photophobia
or diarrhea. Prodromic
phase includes visual disturbance.
Usually it attacks half the

guide in continuous or gated
pulse mode. It has a wavelength–
10,600 nm. It is well absorbed by
water, there is rapid soft tissue
remover and has a shallow depth
of tissue penetration, which is
important when treating mucosal
lesions especially useful for
cutting dense fibrous tissuefocused
onto the surgical site in a
non-contact fashion. Loss of tactile
sensation is disadvantageous,
but the tissue ablation can be
precise with careful technique.

Coadaptation

adaption of ends of fractured
bone or the edges of a wound
without overlap.

Coaggregation
is the ability of two
genetically distinct bacteria to recognize
and adhere to one another
is called co-aggregation and the

diastolic pressure remains the
same. Harsh systolic murmur
may be heard in back. ECG shows
left ventricular hypertrophy.

Coated hairy tongue
is a yellow,
whitish or pigmented covering on
all or a portion of the tongue’s
dorsal surface. Normally keratinized
surface layers of filliform
papillae are continuously desquamated
due to friction of food and
anterior upper teeth. These are
replaced by new epithelial cells
from below. When tongue movements
becomes restricted during
illness the papilla enlarges and
become heavily coated. Longer
papilla entangles food particles of
different colors. Tobacco smoke
colors it black. Mid dorsum is first
to be affected. Dehydration and
terminally ill patients also develop
thick coatings. Nicotinamide
deficiency may produce
black hairy tongue in experimental
animals. Systemic antibiotics
may also produce hairy tongue.
Through scrapping and cleaning
of tongue is advised.

popular with clinicians because
they are easily deformed and
shape into appliance. Heat treated
wires have increased values yield
strength and resilience.

molecule and is incorporated in
many enzymes. Human body
contains 100 to 150 mg of it.
Generally there is no deficiency
of cobalt in human being Daily
requirement is of 2 microgram. Its
deficiency leads to anemia,

In the year 1952, Jean Piaget,
a Swiss psychologist,
formulated a theory on how children
with adolescent think and
acquire knowledge. He derived
his theories from direct observation
of children by questioning
the about their thinking. Like
other theories it also passes
through relatively distinct stages
and its development is based on
one dominant individual. This
process of adaptation is made up
of 3 functional variants. Assimilation
concerns with observing,
recognizing taking up an object
and relating it with earlier experiences
(or) categories. Accommodation
accounts for changing
concepts and strategies as a result
of new assimilated information
piaget calls the strategies and
mental categories as schemes.

critical pH, the solution is unsaturated,
and the mineral will tend
to dissolve until the solution becomes
saturated. The concept of
critical pH is applicable only to
solutions that are in contact with
a particular mineral, such as
enamel.

cytokeratins are found more
generally in epithelial lining
internal body cavities.

Cytokines molecules

by host cells into the local
environment, providing
molecular signals to other cells
thereby affecting their
function.

Cytoskeleton
is a system of
proteins that supports the
topography of the cell membrane
and organizes the arrangement of
the cytoplasmic components into
defined areas. The cytoskeleton is
composed of three types of
filaments: actin (microfilaments),
microtubules, and intermediate
filaments. Its major functions are:
determining cell shape, organelle
anchoring and polarity
determination, motility (and
migration), anchoring of the cell
to external structures, metabolic
functions, separating duplicated
Czechoslovakian caries index
Cysticercosis brain
chromatids and homologous
chromosomes into separate cells.

Czechoslovakian caries index
The
czechoslovakian caries index was
introduced by Poncova, Novak
and Matena in 1956.This index is
mainly used to compare caries
experience in one group with that
of the other groups with a similar
population density but living in
different environments. In this
index, the “variables” seems to be
controlled. In all examination
studies and tests in which this
index is used, the average number
of teeth, tooth surfaces and tooth
areas and the condition of
previously extracted or crowned
teeth were considered.

Dead space
is the part of
lung where air is moved
in and out but no
exchange of gas occurs.

Dean fluorosis index
is
an index for assessment
of dental fluorosis
introduced by Trendley
H. Dean in 1934 - known
as ‘dean’s classification system for
dental fluorosis or ‘dean’s
fluorosis index’. Dental fluorosis
is shown on a seven point scale;
‘normal’, ‘questionable’, ‘very
mild’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’,
moderately severe’, and ‘severe’.
This first description of fluorosis
index could be considered an
ordinal scale, although no
numbers were used. Dean revised
version of his fluorosis index in
1942 where he used a six point
scale, i.e., “normal”, “mild”,
“very mild”, “moderate” and
“severe” where he combined the
“moderately severe” and
“severe” in 1989.

confirming a person’s death.

Debridement
refers to the
treatment of a bacterial infection
by removing irritants (bacteria,
calculus) from the periodontal
pocket so as to allow healing of
adjacent tissues.

Decalcification
refers to the loss of
calcium from your teeth, thereby
weakening the teeth and making
them more susceptible to decay.

Decayed-missing-field-surface index (DMFS)
refers to when the
DMFT index is employed to
assess each individual surface of
each tooth, it is termed as
“decayed-missing-filled-surface
index” (DMFS index). The only
difference here is that the surfaces
D are examined. Each posterior
tooth has five surfaces examined
and recorded; facial, lingual,
mesial, distal and occlusal.
Anterior tooth has four surfaces
for evaluation; facial, lingual,
mesial and distal.

Decayed-missing-filled index (DMF index)
the decayedmissing-
filled index was
introduced by Henry Klein,
Carrole E. Palmer and Knutson
J.W. In 1938 DMF index was the
most universally employed index
for measuring dental caries. This
index is based on the facts that the
dental hard tissues are not selfhealing,
established caries leaves
a scar of some sort. The tooth
either remains decayed, or if
treated it is extracted or it is filled.
The DMFT index is therefore an
irreversible index, meaning that
it measures total lifetime caries
experience.

Deciduous teeth
are the baby teeth;
teeth that exfoliate or shed.

Deep cementopathia
is a condition
where there is inhibition of
continuous cementum formation.
It was hypothesized that
cementopathia was a disease of
eruption and a foreign body
response was initiated by the
cementum, as a result the host
attempted to exfoliate the tooth
which consequently results in
bone resorption and pocket
formation.

Deep dermal burns
refer deep
partial thickness burns.

Deep partial thickness burns
are
the one which involves the
epidermis and papillary dermis
and reticular layer of dermis to
varying depths. A few sweat
glands and hair follicles are left
behind in the reticular dermis
from which there is marginal
spread of epithelium which
gradually covers the wound. This
process usually takes more than
6 weeks and the healing takes
place by extensive repair which
lead to hypertrophic scarring.

Deep sedation
refers to a controlled
state of depressed consciousness
accompanied by partial loss of
reflexes. Person is unable to
respond verbal command.

teeth, e = indicated for extraction,
f = filled teeth. The basic
principles and rules for def index
are the same as that for dmf index.

more common on facial surfaces
and on anterior teeth (see Figure
on page 128).

Delayed eruption of teeth

cases of fibromatosis gingiva will
not allow eruption due to the
presence of connective tissue.
Systemic diseases doing so

Dendrite
is the process that
conducts impulses toward the cell
body of a nerve.

Dendritic cells
are accessory cells
of the immune system. Similar
cells are found in the epidermis
and mucous membranes
(Langerhan’s cells). They increase
in number during inflammation
and may also play a role in repair
processes of the pulp. Dendritic
cells are primarily found in lymphoid
tissues but they are also
widely distributed in connective
tissues, including the pulp. These
cells are termed antigen presenting
cells and are characterized by
Dentritic cytoplasmic processes
and the presence of cell surface
class ii antigens. They are known
to play a central role in the induction
of T cell dependent immunity.
They engulf protein antigens
and then present an assembly of
peptide fragments of the antigens
and class ii molecules.

Dens evaginatus (accessory cusps/supernumerary cusps)
can be
defined as a tubercle or
protuberance from the involved
surface of the affected tooth. This
is also referred by other terms like
occlusal tubercle, Leong’s
premolar, tuberculated premolar,
occlusal enamel pearl. This
protuberance has an outer layer
of enamel, a core of dentin and
may also contain pulp extension
into it. Most commonly it is seen
on occlusal surface of premolars
and also may occur in the form of
a drop, nipple or cylindrical cone.
Occur predominately in people of
mongoloid origin. This condition
is clinically important because
fracture or wear of the tubercle
frequently leads to the major
complications like pulp necrosis,
periapical infection, often before
the root completion.

Dens invaginatus/dens in dente/dilated odontome
is a deep
surface invagination of the
crown/root that is lined by
enamel. Dens invaginatus can be
divided into coronal and
radicular type. Coronal type has
been further divided into three
types (Oehler 1957), type I –
invagination confined to the
crown, type II – extends to the
root portion and ends in a blind
sac that may or may not
communicate with the adjacent
dental pulp, type III – extends
through the root and perforates
in the apical or lateral root surface
without any communication with
the pulp. Radicular type is rare.
Strip of enamel lined invagination
extends into the root surface. In
most cases dens invaginatus is
detected by chance on radiograph.
Clinically an unusual
crown morphology in the form of
dilated peg shaped, barrel shaped
crown or deep foramen coecum
may be important hint. As
maxillary lateral incisors are
commonly involved, these teeth
should be investigated thoroughly
clinically and radiographically,
at least in case of deep pit
in foramen coecum region. If one
tooth is involved contralateral
tooth also should be investigated.
In case of coronal type, pulpal
involvement can occur shortly
after the eruption of tooth, early
diagnosis is mandatory.

refers to the
amount of mass of a material in a
given volume. Common unit of
density is grams/cubic centimetres.

follows: maxillary right quadrant
is #1, maxillary left quadrant is #2,
mandibular left quadrant is #3,
and mandibular right quadrant is
#4.

Dental amalgam
refers to an alloy
of a silver tin alloy containing
other metals; usually copper and

Dental caries
can be defined as a
microbial disease of the calcified
tissues of the teeth, characterized
by demineralization of the
inorganic portion and destruction
of the organic substances of the
tooth resulting in cavitations.
Dental caries can occur on any
aspect of the tooth but the surfaces
which are more prone to the
accumulation of plaque and
bacteria, are the one which are
more susceptible to caries. Closely
knitted plaque has a very complex
structure and harbors variety of
microorganisms. Formation of
cavity requires acid producing
bacteria, substrate, plaque, and
host susceptibility factor.

Dental caries severity index
for
primary teeth was introduced by
Aubrey Chosack in 1985. This

addition to ‘def’ figures,
especially when investigating
preventive measures.

these colors and smooth surface
anatomy can be termed as dental
stains or dental discoloration.

fiberoptic endoscope fits on to the
periodontal probes designed to
accept the system. This device
allows clear visualization, deep in
to the gingival pockets and
furcation areas.

Dental fluorosis
is a hypoplasia or
hypomaturation of tooth enamel
or dentin produced by chronic
ingestion of excessive amount of
fluoride during the period when
the teeth are developing. The

is called “mottled enamel”. G.V.
Black and Fredrick S. McKay
were the first to coin the term
“mottled enamel” in 1916 in
Colorado, USA.

Dental groove
originates in the
incisive papilla region and
extends backwards to touch the
gingival groove in the canine
region and then laterally to end
in the molar region.

Dental health index (DHI)
was developed
by Carpay J.J., Neiman
F., Konig K.G., Felling A.J.A. and
Laminers J.G.M in 1983.The DHI
uses selected teeth for developing
the index. Any number of teeth
may be examined and the denominator
is adjusted accordingly.
The DHI was developed to
minimize the difference between
sound and affected (or extracted)
teeth. The sound teeth were given
a score of “+1” and the affected
(or extracted) teeth were given a
score of “-1”.

of dental mirror handle. There
may be tenderness to percussion
or dull percussion note on the
buccal or palatal aspect of tooth
that shows inflammation of
periodontal ligament and
periodontitis. Greater tenderness
to percussion in an apical direction
on percussing the occlusal
aspect of tooth is suggestive of
pulpal and periapical infection.

mandibular premolar and
maxillary third molar. Multiple
dentigerous cysts may be
accompanied with basal cell
nevus syndrome or cleidocranial
dysostosis. Cyst varies from 2 cm
in diameter to large expansion of
jaws. Cysts usually yield a straw
colored thin liquid. Cyst is
painless and causes delayed
eruption of tooth. Painless cyst is
indicative of some infection. It
generally does not expand so
much so that it may press sensory
nerve. Pain is localized but may
be referred to any part of face.
Smaller lesions can be surgically

amorphous with atubular dentin.
There is no treatment.

Dentin
forms the main portion of
the tooth which is covered by
enamel in the crown region and
cementum in the root region.
Dentin is hard, dense, calcified
tissue similar to the enamel
however it is softer than enamel
and but hardest than the
cementum. Dentin is yellow and
elastic in nature and capable of
forming a new dentin called as
secondary dentin. Composition -
70% inorganic substance, 30%
organic and water.

Dentin secondary
refers to a dentin
formed after the eruption of tooth.

Dentinal tubule
refers to
microscopic canals that run from
the outside of the dentin to the
nerve inside the tooth.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta
is a
developmental defect, inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait.
In this condition the permanent
and primary dentitions are
involved, enamel appears to be
normal, roots are also affected.
Post eruption, and there is a rapid
calcification of the pulp chambers
and root canals which will lead to
the darkening in the color of the
clinical crown. Characteristic
findings consist of a peculiar
opalescent purplish-brown or
gray color of the teeth. Rapid
attrition of the crowns, and
reduction in carious lesions.
Enamel, cementum, and
periodontal membrane show no
microscopic abnormalities, but
there are many changes noted in
the dentine. The dentinoenamel
junction is straight rather than
scalloped which probably
accounts for the weak attachment
of the enamel to the dentine and
the tendency for the enamel to
chip, leaving exposed dentine.
Irregular tubular arrangement
can be seen. Smaller number of
tubuli, decreasing toward the
pulp. Occasional larger diameter
of tubuli and cellular inclusions.
Numerous branching of the
tubuli. Poor calcification of the
teeth. The circumpulpal dentine
picture resembles irregular
secondary dentine formation. The
teeth are much smaller than
normal, about one-half the
dimensions or one-eighth the
volume. Enamel appears as a very
thin layer, and is quickly worn
away in the mouth. Pulp
chambers and canals show in the
radiographs of deciduous teeth
during formation, but are almost
completely obliterated in erupted
teeth of the permanent set. The
teeth are not sensitive to grinding,
indicating that the dentine does
not contain vital fibrils. Enamel
hypoplasia is a disorder affecting
the structure of the teeth. It is
often seen as one component
associated with many syndromes
or enamel hypoplasia may be
mild enough resulting in a pitting
of the enamel surface or a
horizontal line across the enamel
of the crown.

Dentinoma
is rare tumor. It
develops in central mandible in
molar area. Radiographic
findings are not specific. It is
large, solitary, opaque mass.
Masses of calcified material are
seen. It consists of irregular dentin
as there is lack of enamel
formation. Surgical excision with
thorough curettage helps.

Dentition
refers to the natural teeth
as a unit.

Dentition
consist of the natural
teeth in the jaw bones that consist
of primary and permanent
dentition. The dentition is of three
type’s i.e. Primary dentition,
mixed dentition and primary
dentition.

Dentoalveolar anterior cross bite
are the one in which one or more
maxillary anterior teeth are in
lingual relation to the mandibular
anteriors termed dento-alveolar
anterior cross bite. This is often
manifested as single tooth cross
bite and usually occurs due to
over retained deciduous teeth
that deflect the erupting
permanent teeth into a palatal
position. They can be effectively
treated using tongue blades,
catalans appliance and double
cantilever spring with posterior
bite plate.

Dentoalveolar fractures
are those
that involve avulsion, subluxation,
displacement or fracture of
teeth in conjunction with fracture
of the alveolus. They may occur
alone or in association with
mandible.

Dentrifice
is a paste used to clean
the tooth, i.e. tooth paste.

stabilize and retain denture by
increasing peripheral seal. It is
commonly available in powder
and paste form.

Denture base
is a material used to
contact the oral tissues and
support artificial teeth.

Denture hyperplasia
is a chronic
inflammatory tissue reaction to ill
fitting dentures with overextended
or sharp denture border.
It develops in 5-10% of elderly
denture wearers. It is painful
when traumatized and ulcerated.
It is seen as single or several folds
of pink tissue in the sulcus related
to periphery of a denture. Lower
jaw is more frequently affected.
After adjustment of dentures, the
inflammation and edema may
subside and produce clinical improvement.

Denture induced fibrous hyperplasia
refers to denture hyperplasia.

Denture irritation hyperplasia
refers to denture hyperplasia.

Denture porcelain
is defined as a
white translucent ceramic fired to
a glazed state. It has an excellent
biocompatibility, natural
appearance and high resistance to
wear and distortion. Disadvantages
include brittleness; require
mechanical attachment and
produces clicking sound on
contact. Higher density increases
weight of teeth.

Denture sore mouth
is a diffuse
inflammation of maxillary
denture bearing area. Pain and
burning are usually reported
during periods of exacerbation
although raw area will persist for
years till denture is born. Raised
antibody titres against Candida
Albicans are found in salvia and
serum. Three clinical varieties are
found, a localized simple
inflammation or pin point
hyperaemia, a more diffuse
erythema granular type.

Denture stomatitis
is an inflammation
of oral mucosa associated
with wearing dentures. It is
generally found under maxillary
mucosa. Mucosa becomes red
and velvety appearance. There
may be burning sensations (see
Figure on page 138).

Deontological ethics
is an ethical
theory that focuses on morality
rather the consequences of action.

Deposition
refers to a process of
laying down of new bone.

Depression
is an abnormal
psychological state. There
develops a low mood, interest
and vitality. It differs from normal
sadness in the severity of
symptoms.

Depressor angularis oris
is a facial
muscle that arises from oblique
line of mandible below and lateral
to depressor labii inferioris. It
draws the angle of mouth
downwards and laterally in
opening the mouth and in
sadness.

Depressor labii inferioris
is a facial
muscle. It is quadrilateral and
arises from oblique line of
mandible. It draws the lower limb
downwards and laterally during
mastication.

Dermoid cyst
is a painless slow
growing swelling at the site of
lines of embryonic fusion. It is
generally seen above the outer
canthus of eye, behind the ear,
root of nose and midline of body.
Majority of these develop during
adulthood. It produces a bulge in
mouth causing difficulty in
eating. It is smooth, soft and non
tender when infection develops,
sinus may be formed. Overlying
skin remains free but is attached
to deeper tissue. Once removed
surgically these don’t recur.

Descriptive study
is a research that
involves describing, analyzing
and interpreting data to evaluate
a current population event or
situation.

refers to the
blocking of painful stimuli which
causes dentinal hypersensitivity.

Desiccate
is to make dry; to remove
all moisture.

Desmin
are the filaments that are
found predominantly in muscle
cells. It forms an interconnecting
network perpendicular to the
long axis of the cell. Desmin fibres
anchor and orientate the z bands
in myofibrils, thus generating the
striated pattern.

Desmoplastic fibroma
is benign
neoplasm arising from
mesenchymal tissues of jaw bone.
It develops in younger age group.
Mandible is affected more. These
are generally asymptomatic
neoplasm. Neither teeth nor
lesion is tender. Treatment
includes local excision and
curettage.

Development (Moyers)
includes
all naturally occurring
unidirectional changes in the life
of individual from its existence as
a single cell to its elaboration as
multi-functional unit terminating
in death.

Development (Todd)
refers to
progress towards maturity.

Developmental anomaly
is an
abnormality in which a tooth has
deviated from its normal form
due to aberration in odontogenesis.
The dental anomalies
have been reported more often in
Eskimos, Mongols and Orientals.
Such variations can be traced to
ancestral times and have been
reported to have a genetic basis.

Developmental depression
is a
concavity in a surface that formed
while the tooth was developing.

Devitalization pulpotomy
is a two
stage procedure and involves the
placement of devitalizing paste
over the pulp exposure in the first
sitting to fix the entire coronal and
radicular pulp tissue. The basic
technique, first introduced by
Witzel in 1898, used a true
paraformaldehyde paste.

Dewels method
is a three-step
extraction procedure. In first step
the deciduous canines are
extracted to create space for the
alignment of the incisors. This
step is carried out at 8-9 years of
age. A year later the deciduous
first molars are extracted so that
the eruption of first premolar is
accelerated. This is followed
where in the first premolars are
enucleated at the time of
extraction of the first deciduous
molars. This is frequently
necessary in the mandibular arch
where the canines often erupt
before the first premolars.

df index
is another method of
getting around the exfoliation
problem the ‘df’ index in which
the missing teeth are ignored.
This is the method of choice of the
world health organization in their
basic survey technique. The ‘df’
index can be applied to the whole
tooth as the decayed-filled-tooth
(‘dft’ index) or to the individual
surfaces as the decayed-filledsurface
(‘dfs’ index).

Dhatura seeds
are used to stupefy
travellers in railway stations,
places of pilgrimage in order to
commit theft, robbery and rape.
These are mixed with colored
food, cereals, vegetables curry etc.
An average size fruit contain 400-
500 seeds. Seeds are similar to of
brinjals. Its poisoning results in
giddiness, vomiting and
staggering gait. Face is flushed,
pupils are dilated. Patient makes
pill rolling movements. Stomach
is to be washed with weak
solution of potassium permanganate
or 2-4% tannic acid.
Emetics are to be given.

Diabetes insipidus
is a disease
resulting from an inadequate
secretion of antidiuretic hormone
marked by great thrust and
passage of a large volume of urine.

Diabetes mellitus
represents a
syndrome of disordered glucose
metabolism and inappropriate
hyperglycemia that results from
an absolute deficiency in insulin
secretion, a reduction in the
biologic effectiveness of insulin or
both. Predisposing factors
includes: genetic disorder of
primary destruction of islets of
Langerhan’s in the pancreas
caused by inflammation, cancer
or surgery, an endocrine condition,
such as Hyperpituitarism
and hyperthyroidism, administration
of steroids, resulting in
iatrogenic diabetes. Classification
of diabetes mellitus includes
insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus (IDDM) – type 1, non
insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus (NIDDM) - type II.

Diabetes mellitus type I
The
primary form of diabetes is
genetic. This is a more severe
form. In type I, circulating insulin
is essentially absent, plasma
glucagon levels are elevated and
pancreatic β-cells do not respond
to insulinogenic stimuli. Human
lymphocyte antigen (HLA) which
is located on 6th human
chromosome adjacent to immune
response genes are closely
associated with development of
type I diabetes.

Diabetes mellitus type II
describes
a heterogeneous group composed
of milder forms of diabetes that
occurs most frequently in adults
and only occasionally in children.
Most type II diabetics do not
require exogenous insulin
therapy to sustain life.

Diabetic gangrene
occurs in a
diabetic patient of above the age
of 50 years who presents, pain,
ulceration and discharge. Lesion
starts with boil or trauma, usually
great toe is involved. In moist
gangrene affected part is swollen
with offensive discharge. It
spreads extensively with sloughing
of tissues. There is no line of
demarcation.

Diabetic kidneys

Diabetic nephropathy
Incidence of
nephropathy is between 10-20%.
All such patients having diabetic
nephropathy, there is proteinuria
with progressive renal failure.
There develops enlargement of
kidney. Patients of diabetic type
I develops more of nephropathy.
There should be protein
restriction with curtailment of
sodium and potassium.
Hypertension is to be controlled
along with diabetes (see Figure on
page 141).

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
microangiopathy with obliteration

myonisitol uptake and increased
nerve accumulation of sorbital
and fructose are pathological
mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy.
It manifests with symmetric,
pain and loss of tendon jerks.

Diabetic retinopathy
Changes are
either simple or proliferative. In
background lesions there is
micro–aneurysm formation,
venous dilatation and dot
hemorrhages. In proliferative
form new vessel are lost. Senile
cataracts develop 10-15 years
earlier in diabetics. Snow flake
cataracts are characteristic in
young diabetics. In proliferative
type photocoagulation is the only
answer.

Diagnodent
is a new method of
caries detection introduced by
KaVo, Germany in 1999, which is
based on the principle of fluorescence.
It enables to recognize
pathological changes that are
difficult or even impossible to
detect, such as initial lesions,
demineralization, changes affecting
the tooth enamel. The
incidence of fissure, approximal
and residual caries can be
identified. It is also useful in
determining the amount of carious
involvement/decalcification in
different areas of the same tooth.

Diagnosis
is identification of health
related problem determination of
the nature of disease.

to define exact parameters of
lesions.

Diffusion
refers to spreading,
spreading of dissolved particles.

Dilaceration
is an abnormal
angulation or bend in the root or
less frequently the crown of a
tooth. It is caused by trauma to
the root development. Any tooth
may be affected. Dilaceration do
not interfere with eruption.
Dilacerated tooth erupt into
complete occlusion, but follow
altered path. Minor dilacerations
of normal teeth requires no
treatment. If eruption is delayed
or abnormal, surgical exposure
and orthodontic movement is
required. Caution must be
exerted during endodontic
treatment of dilacerated teeth to
avoid perforation of the root.

Dilantin sodium

anticonvulsant drug used in
epileptic seizures. But it causes
fibrous hyperplasia of gingiva.
Gingival hyperplasia begins as

conductor laser that uses some
combination of al, gallium and
arsenide to change electric energy
into light energy. It has a wave
length range from 800-980 nm.
Laser energy is delivered
fiberoptically in continuous-wave
and gated – pulse mode used in
contact with the tissue. It is poorly
absorbed by tooth structure so
that soft tissue surgery can be
performed safely in close
proximity to enamel, dentine and
cementum. It is an excellent soft
tissue surgical laser indicated for
cutting and coagulating gingiva
and mucosa and for soft tissue
curettage, or sulcular debridement.

Diphodont

short incubation period of 4 days.
Child becomes restless, headache,
fever, sore throat and mild
redness and oedema of pharynx
may takes place. Patchy deptheric
membrane often begins on tonsils
and around. Fever may be very
high. On examination one finds
uniform greyish or yellowish
white membrane covering tonsil.
It may extend to pharynx and soft
palate. Membrane is adherent to
underlying mucosa. Cervical
glands are enlarged. In severe
case membrane may show
hemorrhagic areas and there may
be bleeding. Neurological

dentistry is called radiovisiography
(RVG). According to
Wenzel (1998), the sensitivities are

the middle portion of the 6 inch
wire is twisted around a suitable
tooth and free ends of wire is
twisted together to produce a
plaited wire. Similarly it’s done
throughout the upper and lower
arch, then after the reduction of

keratotic plugs. Most of the intraoral
lesions in DLE occur on the
cheeks with the gingival tissues
and border of lip. Hot and spicy
food will produce burning
sensation. It responds to cortisone
well.

Discoloration of teeth
occurs due
to varios reasons yellow is due to
heavy plaque build up. Green
color is due to poor oral hygiene
and is difficult to remove. Black
is due to iron compounds from
oral fluid. Tobacco stain is rare
but develops with chromogenic
bacteria.

Diarrhea is a common feature.
Bleeding per rectum may be
severe. Severe cases may result in
intestinal obstruction. Barium
enema shows outpouching of
colonic mucosa.

determine decayed - missing -
filled teeth (dmft), or decayedmissing–
filled surfaces (dmfs),
when surfaces are counted.

identification.

Doctor-Nurse relationship
makes
a team although doctor role is to
diagnose and cure the patient
while nursing role lies in the
process of care helping,
comforting and guiding.

Doctor-Patient relationship
Patient
comes unbidden to a doctor and
enters voluntarily into a contract
to agree to follow doctor’s advice.
Doctor exercises an authorative
role because being superior in
professional knowledge. If doctor
communicates well on an
emotional plane, on a cultural
plane and at intellectual plane he
is a successful doctor and patient
will develop confidence in him.

Dracunculiasis
is caused by largest
viviparous nematode, the
dracunculus medinesis popularly
known as guinea worm. Larvae
liberated by female worms are
ingested by an intermediate host
cyclops. People consuming the
contaminated water with cyclops
develop dracunculiasis. The
lesions are usually seen in various
parts of body, feet, nape of neck
and back. During removal of
worm it is broken. The affected
part becomes swollen, painful

Ecologic plaque hypothesis (Marsh PD 1994)
proposes that
the organisms associated with
disease may also be present at
sound sites, but at levels too low
to be clinically relevant. Disease
is a result of a shift in the balance
of the resident microflora drives
by a change in local environmental
conditions. The bacterial
composition of plaque remains
relatively stable despite regular
exposure to minor environmental
perturbations. This microbial
homeostasis is due to a dynamic
balance of both synergistic and
antagonistic microbial interactions.
However, homeostasis can
break down, leading to shifts in the
balance of the micro flora, thereby
predisposing sites to disease.

formation. It is usually found on
maxillary molars. It does not
require any treatment.

Enamel
refers to the outermost
surface of the anatomical crown.
It is thickest at the top of the
crown and becomes thinner and
ends in a knife edge at the cervical
line. The color of the enamel
varies with its thickness and
mineralization. The color varies
from yellowish white to grayish
white. Enamel appears whiter if
it is thicker. The more mineralized
enamel shows more translucency.
The translucency gives yellowish
color to the tooth. Enamel is
densely mineralized, hardest and
highly polished in the human
body. This dense mineralization
gives the enamel ability to resist
wear and tear of the crown.

Fever hypoplasia
refers to a linear
alteration of enamel that may be
manifest as the result of a febrile
episode during the chronological
point in tooth development such
that the distribution of enamel
changes will vary between teeth
at different stages of crown
formation. Some studies have
indicated that the exanthematous
diseases, including measles,
chickenpox and scarlet fever are
etiological factors. In general, it
might be stated that any systemic
disease is potentially capable of
producing enamel hypoplasia,
since the ameloblasts are one of
the most sensitive groups of cells
in the body in terms of metabolic
function. The type of hypoplasia
occurring from these disease
states is usually of the pitting
variety. Clinical studies indicate
that most cases of enamel
hypoplasia involve those teeth
that form within the first year
after birth.

Fibre optic transillumination (FOTI)
is an advanced diagnostic
aid that has been designed for the
detection of approximal caries by
Freidman and Marcus in 1970.
The principle of transillumination
is that there is a different
index of light transmission for
decayed and sound tooth
structure. Illumination is
delivered by means of fibre
optics from the light source to the
tooth structure. The resultant
changes in light distribution as
the light traverses the tooth are
then recorded as an image for
analysis. Since tooth decay has a
lower index of light transmission
than the sound tooth structure,
an area of decay shows up as a
darkened shadow that follows
the decay along the path of
dentinal tubules.

elements (see Figure on page 180).

Fifth pharyngeal pouch
appears
as a diverticulum of the fourth
pouch. The endoderm of the fifth
pouch forms the ultimobranchial
body. The calcitonin secreting
cells of this structure, however,
are derived from neural crest
tissue and are eventually
incorporated into the thyroid
gland. The laryngeal ventricles
could present the remnants of
fifth pharyngeal pouch.

Figure eight suture
is also a type
of interdental ligation where the
suture given is in the shape of
eight hence the name and is
indicated the two flaps are not in
close apposition to each other.

Filament circuit
is the circuit that
regulates the flow of electric
current to the filament of X-ray
tube.

Filariasis
is caused by two species
Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia
Malayi. Microfilariac mature in
lymph nodes and rarely produce
visible damage. Lymphadenopathy
is characteristic but not diagnostic.
Scrotal swelling is due to
Wuchereria bancrofti. Allergic
manifestations are due to toxic
metabolites released by worm.
Incubation period is one year.
Acute stage shows fever with
inflammation of lymphatic vessels
and swelling of affecting part
of body. Fever subsides but
swelling persists. In chronic
stage typical elephantiasis develops.
Swollen part becomes thick
and rugose/papillomatous.

Files
are periodontal instruments
which have series of blades on
the base and their main purpose
is to fracture or crush the
tenacious calculus. As files can
gouge easily and roughen the
root surface if used improperly,
therefore these are not the ideal
instruments for fine scaling.

Filling
refers to a restoration
placed on a tooth to restore its
function and appearance.

Film badge
is a device to measure
and monitor radiation exposure
worn by persons frequently
exposed to radiation.

Film hanger
is a stainless steel
device equipped with clips used
to hold films during manual
processing.

Film mount
refers to a card board,
plastic or vinyl holder used to
support and arranges dental
radiographs in anatomic order.

Film over exposed
is an exposure
error resulting in dark film due
to excessive exposure to X-ray
time, kilovoltage or milliamperage
or a combination of these.

Film speed
is the sensitivity of film
to radiation exposure.

Final diagnosis
is a diagnosis
based on clinical laboratory data
or biopsy analysis.

Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
is a convenient and
expeditious means of differentiating
cyst from solid tumors and
getting cytological specimen. It is
performed with a 21 gauge needle
fitted to a 10 ml syringe.

Fine particle composite resins
contain fine sized filler particles
of 0.5 to 3 micro mm. It is more
polishable than micro filled
composites.

Finger nail artifact
is a film
handling error, a black finger
print when the film has been
touched by fingers contaminated
with developer.

Finger prints and ridges
The
surface of the palms, fingers,
soles, and toes are marked by
series of ridges and grooves.
They appear either as straight
lines or as a pattern or loops and
whorls, as on the tips of the
digits. These epidermal ridges
develop during the third and
fourth fetal months as the
epidermis conforms to the
contours of the underlying
dermal papillae of the papillary
region. The ridges increase the
surface area of the epidermis and
thus function to increase the grip
of the hand or foot by increasing
friction. Because the ducts of
sweat pores, the sweat and
ridges from fingerprints (or
footprints) when a smooth object
is touched. The ridge pattern is
genetically determined and is
unique for each individual.
Normally, the ridge pattern does
not change during life, except to
enlarge, and thus can serve as the
basis for identification.
Comparing the structural
features of the papillary and
reticular region of the dermis.

Finger rest
stabilizes the hand and
the instrument by providing a
firm fulcrum as movements are
made to activate the instrument,
this helps in preventing injury
and laceration to the gingiva occurring
due to poorly controlled
movements. The fourth/ring finger
is most commonly used as
rest. The finger rest are of two
types: the intraoral rest and the
extra oralrest.

Finger sweep
is an insertion of
index finger into mouth along
the inside of the cheek deep into
throat to the base of the tongue.

Finger-on-finger rest
is
established on the index finger or
thumb of the non operating hand.

Finishing disks
are small abrasive
disks of sand paper used to
contour and polish various
restorations.

First branchial arch
is the first
mandibular pair of branchial
arches the precursor of the jaws,
both maxillary and mandibular
and appropriately bound the
lateral aspects of the stomodeum
which at this stage is merely a
depression in the early facial
region. The maxilla is derived
from a small maxillary
prominence extending cranioventrally
from the much larger
mandibular prominence derived
from the first arch. The cartilage
skeleton of the first arch known
as Meckel’s cartilage, arises at the
41st to 45th day providing a
template for subsequent
development of the mandible
but most of its cartilage
substance disappears in the
formed mandible. The mental
ossicler is the only potion of the
mandible derived from marked
cartilage by endochondral ossification.
Persisting portions of
Meckel’s cartilage from the basis
of major portions of two ear
ossicles, the head and neck of the
maleus, the body and short crus
of the incus and two ligaments,
the anterior ligament of the
malleus and Sphenomandibular
ligament. The musculature of the
mandibular arch is subdivided
and migrates to form: The
muscles of mastication,
mylohyoid muscle, anterior belly
of the digastric, Tensor tympani,
Tensor Veli Palatini muscles all
of which are innervated by the
nerve of the first arch, i.e. the
mandibular division of the Vth
cranial or trigeminal nerve.

First degree burns
are limited only
to the most superficial layers of
epidermis and heal spontaneously
within 7 days because of
abundance of epithelial cells
which regenerate very fast. So this
healing is by regeneration only
and does not leave any scars.

First pharyngeal pouch
is
obliterated by the developing
tongue. The dorsal diverticulum
deepens laterally as the
tubotympanic recess to form the
auditory tube, widening at its
end into the tympanum or
middle ear cavity separated from
the first branchial groove by the
tympanic membrane. The
tympanum occupied by the
dorsal ends of the cartilages of
the first and second branchial
arches develop into the ear
ossicles. The tympanum
maintains contact with the
pharynx via the auditory tube
throughout life. The proximal
portion of the expanding and
elongating auditory tube
becomes lined with respiratory
mucous membrane and fibrous
tissue and cartilage form in its
walls. Chondrification occurs in
the 4th month of influence. From
four centre in the adjacent
mesoderm growth of the
cartilaginous portion of the tube
is greatest between 16 and 28
weeks intrauterine. These after
increase in tubal length is
primarily in the osseous portion
of the tube. The changing
location of the opening of the
auditory tube reflects the growth
of the nasopharynx. The tubal
orifice is inferior to the hard
palate in the fetus, is at level it at
birth, and well above the hard
palate in the adult.

First transitional period
is
characterized by the emergence
of the first permanent molars and
the exchange of the deciduous
incisors with the permanent
incisors.

Fissure
is defined as deep clefts
between adjoining cusps. They
provide area for retention of
caries producing agents. These
defects occur on occlusal
surfaces of the molars and
premolars, with tortuous
configuration that are difficult to
assess from the surfaces. These
areas are impossible to keep
clean and highly susceptible to
advancement of the carious
lesion (Orbans, 1990).

Fissure sealant
is a material that
is placed in the pits and fissures
of teeth in order to prevent or
arrest the development of dental
caries.

Fissure sealing
is a procedure
done to seal the occlusal fissures.
Occlusal fissures are natural
stagnation areas where caries
occurs. In the past fissure filling
was done using amalgam. In it
one has to cut a cavity in sound
enamel. But new glass isonomer
cement allows fissure sealing to
be done without any cavity
preparation.

Fistula
is an abnormal opening
between an internal structure
and the surface of body.

Fixation of film
is a procedure
done to fix a film, i.e. when fixer
solution removes the unexposed
under developed silver halide
crystals from the film emulsion.

Fixed drug eruption
is the lesion
which appears at same site each
time a drug is taken. Reaction
subsides when the drug is
discontinued. Reaction causes
vasculitis and subsequent
damage to the vessel wall giving
rise to erythema and edema of
superficial layers of skin and
mucosa.

Fixed functional appliances
are
those appliances that are fitted
on the teeth by the operator and
cannot be removed by the patients.

Fixed habit breakers
are the fixed
appliance that helps in breaking
the deleterious habit of the child.

refers to the excess material
that extrudes beyond the
intended margins of a restoration.

in the young child the foot
appears to be flat because of the
pressure of a large amount of
subcutaneous fat on the sole.
Otherwise medial margin of foot
from heal to the first metatarsal
head is arched above the ground
because of medial longitudinal
arch. Medial longitudinal arch
consists of calcaneum, the talus
navicular bone and three cuneiform
bones and the first three
metatarsal. Flat foot person is not
able to run fast for long.

Flatus
is a gas which is formed in
the intestine and released from
rectum.

Florescence
refers to emit visible
light in the blue or green spectrum.

Florid osseous dysplasia
is a
disease of disordered cementum
and bone development. Radiopaque
masses may involve
multiple quadrants. Cause is not
known. No treatment is indicated.

Floss
is thinner than dental tap and
passes more easily in between
teeth. The wax coating on dental
floss helps make passing floss
through the contact area easily.
Polytetrafluoro ethylene floss is
made of Gore-Tex type of
material and it slips easily and
resists fraying.

Flow
is a plastic deformation that
occurs while the material is
setting and in the process of
developing its final strength.

Fluorescence
is the emission of
light by an object at different
wave lengths. Dental porcelains
are also fluorescent under
ultraviolet light.

Fluorescence microscopy
is used
in immunology. It employs the
principles of emission of a
different wavelength of light
each wavelength strikes a
fluorescent object.

Fluoride electrode coupled with standard pH meter
is the most
recent and universally acceptable
fluoride estimation method.
Fluoride electrodes of different
make such as Orion (Model 94-09).
Radiometer (Model F 1052 F
fluoride electrode) are available.
This method allows fluoride in
aqueous solutions to be measured
quickly simply, economically and
accurately.

Fluoride mouth rinse
is done
weekly rather than monthly,
some recommended on daily
basis for limited period. It
reduces caries by 20 to 30% and
are inexpensive.

Fluoride probe
is a computerised
periodontal probe consisting of
a probe, handpiece, a digital
readout, a foot switch and a
computer. It is used to measure
the pocket depth and has a high
degree of accuracy.

Fluoride
refers to topical
application of a gel or liquid that
prevents decay.

Fluoride tablets
are effective
means of fluoridation that act
both systematically and topically
at different times of tooth
eruption. Guidelines for their use
have been laid down by Joyston-
Bactal with the recommended
dosage being: 6 months to 2 yrs-
0.25 mg, 3 Yrs to 4 yrs - 0.50 mg,
Above 4 yrs - 1.0 mg.

Fluoride toothpaste
is a method of
topical fluoridation. Most of the
tooth pastes now a days contains
fluoride to prevent caries. Only
a pea sized amount of tooth paste
is used but it has to be kept in
mouth. It should not be rinsed
out immediately after brushing.

Fluoride varnish
is a preventive
procedure in which highly
concentrated varnish is painted
over teeth. Semiannual application
is sufficient.

Fluorides topical
are the ones
where fluorides applied in direct
contact of teeth through mouth
rinses and tropical fluoride
application.

Fluorine
is an essential element,
about 95% of fluoride in the body
is found in bones and teeth. It is
essential for formation of dental
enamel. Drinking water contains
0.5 mg/L but in endemic areas
of fluorosis water contains 3 to
12 mg of fluoride. Sea fish, cheese
and tea are rich in fluorides. 0.5 to
0.8/L in water is considered safe
limit in our country. Deficiency of
it leads to dental caries.

Fluoroscopy
is a form of
radiography in which image is
displayed in real time.

Fluorosis
leads to a permanent
damage to the enamel, which
consists of white or brown spots
that appear on the children’s
teeth. When fluoride reaches the
cells, which make enamel,
ameloblasts, become poisoned.
As they degenerate they lay
down irregular enamel. Instead
of the regular hydroxyapatite,
they will produce mottled,
porous and thin enamel. As the
poisoning worsens the enamel
may even be absent. At the same
time the enamel is being mottled
other hard and ligament tissues
are being affected as well.
Fluorosis also refers to discoloration
of the enamel due to
excessive fluoride absorption
(greater than one 1 part per
million) into the bloodstream,
also called enamel mottling.

Fluorosis risk index (FRI)
was introduced
by David G. Fendrys, in
1990. The FRI, is designed to permit
a more accurate identification
of associations between age-specific
exposures, fluoride sources
and the development of enamel
fluorosis. The FRI divides the
enamel surfaces of the permanent
dentition into two developmentally
related groups surface
zones, designated either as having
begun - (I) formation during
the first year of life (“Classification
I”) or (ii) formation during
the third through sixth years of
life (“Classification II).

Flush terminal plane
is the mesiodistal
relation between the distal
surface of the upper and a lower
second deciduous molar is called
the terminal plane. A normal feature
of deciduous dentition is to
find a flush terminal plane where
the distal surface of the upper
and lower second deciduous
molars are same in the same vertical
plane.

seen. Dyskeratosis is not present.
Lesions may regress suddenly.

Fogged film
is a processing error.
It appears gray and lacks detail
and contrast. Improper safelight
in dark room may result it.

Folic acid
was discovered in 1941.
Word comes from folium means
leaf. Folates are essential for
synthesis of DNA. Richest source
are liver, eggs and leafy
vegetable. Commonest cause of
nutritional anemia is folate
deficiency especially in
pregnancy hence 500 micro gram
of folic acid is given to pregnant
leady. Deficiency of it causes
irritability, forgetfulness and
mental sluggishness. 90% alcoholics
are said to suffer from it.

Fontanelles
are the cartilages that
bridge the gap between the
bones. They are made up of dura
mater, primitive periosteum and
the aponeurosis from inside outwards.
Fontanelles present at
birth are Anterior fontanelle: between
the two parietal bones and
the frontal bone, Posterior fontanelle: between the two parietal
bones and the occipital bone,
Sphenoid fontanelle: between
the fontal, parietal, temporal and
the sphenoid bone, Mastoid fontanelle:
between the parietal, occipital,
temporal bone.

buccal mucosa. Histologically
these are similar with sebaceous
glands except hair follicle as they
contain lipase secretion. Function
of Fordyces Granules is not
known. They appear small,
white submucosal plaques.

Forensic dentistry

of dentistry that relates and
applies dental facts to legal
problems, dental identification,
malpractice, litigation and dental
licensure.

Formaldehyde
is a highly toxic
irritant gas which precipitates
and destroys protein. It is

bacteria, fungi and viruses. It is
used to disinfect rooms. In
addition it can be used to
disinfect blankets, beds, books
and other articles which cannot
be boiled.

Forward decay
refers to a type of
lesion where the caries starts in
the enamel and then it involve
the dentin i.e. wherever the
caries in enamel is larger than in
dentin.

Fossa
refers to a shallow
depression on the lingual
(tongue) surfaces of some front
teeth (see Figure on page 189).

probe that determines pocket
depth along with detection of
CEJ from where level of clinical
attachment level is automatically
detected.

Four handed dentistry
is the
delivery of the dental treatment
by the dentist and assistant
working together at chair side.

Fourth branchial arch
The cartilage
of this arch probably forms the
thyroid cartilage. The arch
muscles develop into the
cricothyroid and constrictors of
the pharynx, the palatoglossus
muscle of the muscles of the soft
palate and the palatoglossus
muscle of tongue. The nerve of
the fourth arch is superior
laryngeal branch of the vagus
(Xth cranial nerve), which
innervates these muscles. The
fourth arch artery of the left side
forms the arch of the aorta, that
of the right side contribute to the
right subclavian and branchocephalic
arteries. The para aortic
bodies of chromaffin cells that
secrete noradrenaline arise from
the ectomesenchyme of the
fourth and sixth branchial
arches.

Fourth degree burns
refers to a
type of burn where the damage
extends beyond the skin till
muscle, fascia or bone. However,
this is not a universally accepted
term and is not used.

Fourth pharyngeal pouch
The fate
of the endoderm of the ventral
diverticulum is uncertain; the
lining membrane may contribute
to thyhmus or thyroid tissue.

Fracture of teeth
is a cause of
sudden severe trauma such as
fall, blow or road accident. There
are several classifications of
fractured teeth. If crown is
fractured but pulp is maintained
the teeth remains alive. There
may not be severe pain. Tooth
may be sore and slightly loose.
Fractured crown exposing pulp
is more serious. Pulpotomy or
pulpectomy may be required.

Fracture
refers to the breach in
continuity.

Fracture stress strength
is a limit
of applied force which a material
can withstand without fracture.

flows the solder over the metal
parts readily and penetrates
small openings and joints by
capillary action.

Free graft
refers to a tissue for
grafting is completely removed
from its donor site.

Free radical
is any atom (e.g.
oxygen, nitrogen) with at least
one unpaired electron in the
outer most shell, and is capable
of independent existence. Free
radicals are highly reactive due
to the presence of unpaired
electrons

Free running pulsed mode
is
unique in that large peak
energies of laser light are emitted
for an extremely short time span,
usually in micro seconds,
followed by a relatively long
time in which the laser is off. For
example, a free running pulsed
laser with pulse duration of 100
μs with pulses delivered at 10
pulses per second would mean
that the energy at the surgical site
is only present for 1/1000 of a
second and absent for the
remaining 99.999% of that second.

Frenectomy
refers to complete
removal of a frenum.

Frenum 
efers to a fold of mucus
membrane attaching the cheeks
and lips to upper and lower
arches.

individual score is represented in
a data set. It can be presented
visually as a histogram of a stem
and leaf plot.

Friction blister
occurs due to
excessive friction. Epidermis
separates from dermis and
plasma oozes in for example
blister of ill fitting shoes.

Frictional keratosis
is an isolated
area of thickened whitish oral
mucosa which can be identified
to local irritant. Histological
studies show various degrees of
hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis
and acanthosis. Within 2 weeks
of treatment lesion will start
reducing in size. Frictional
keratosis occurs due to some
local irritant an isolated area of
thickened whitish oral mucosa
develops. Histologically these
show varied hyperkeratosis and
acanthosis. Broken and rough
edges may cause it. Majority of
lesions will be reduced, if irritant
is removed. Biopsy will help.

Frigidity
is the inability to initiate
or maintain the sexual pattern.

Front teeth
see anterior teeth.

Frontal lobe tumor
It develops
slowness of comprehension,
memory disorder, childish
behavior and impaired

urinary urgency. Ataxic gait and
profound mental changes
appear. With the left frontal
lesion intelligence is reduced.
Motor aphasia develops.

Frost bite
Symptoms of frost bite
develop when skin temperature
drops from 20 to 14° F. It may be
due to impaired circulation,
injury or shock. Blisters form
within 24-36 hours and become
hard and black in two weeks.
Tissues up to bones may be
involved. There may be
discoloration from blue to violet.

Frozen blood
RBCs can be frozen
and stored for up to 3 years but
the technique is costlier. It is to
maintain a supply of rare blood
type. In it plasma components
are being removed.

Full mouth indices
are those
indices that measure the patient’s
entire periodontium or dentition.
Eg: Russel’s Periodontal Index
(PI).

where all the soft tissue
including the periosteum is
reflected to expose the soft tissue.

Fumigation theory
is given by
Guy de Cahuliac (1300-1368),
was the greatest surgeon of
Middle Ages believed that
worms caused dental decay. He
advocated fumigation with seeds
of leek, onion and hyoscyamus
as a cure for dental caries. The
fumigation was also used in
earlier times by Chinese and
Egyptians.

Function of spinal cord
Each
nerve is attached to spinal cord
by two roots. Dorsal roots
consists of sensory pathways and
anterior root the motor
pathways. Spinal cord provides
a pathway for sensory information
travelling from periphery to
brain. It also provides a pathway
for motor information coming
from brain and going to
periphery. In addition spinal
cord acts as a major reflex center.

Functional anterior cross bite
is
seen in pseudo class II
malocclusion where the
mandible is compelled to close in
a position forward of its true
centric relation. It occurs as a
result of occlusal prematurities
that cause the deflection of the
mandible into a forward position
during closure. These can be
treated by eliminating the
occlusal prematurities.

Functional matrix theory
refer
Moss Hypothesis.

Functional measure index (FMI)
was proposed by Sheiham A.,
Maizels J., and Maizels, A. in
1987, as one of the two
alternative indices, which were
modifications of the DMFT
index. In FMI, the “Filled and the
“Sound’ teeth are weighted
equally, while, the ‘Decayed and
‘Missing’ teeth are given zero
weight. The FMI is calculated by
adding the Filled and sound
teeth and then dividing by total
number of teeth present.

Functional tongue thrust
is said to
be present when the tongue
thrust mechanism is an adaptive
behavior developed to achieve
an oral seal, it can be grouped as
functional.

Functions of proteins
These
provide material for growth,
wear and tear of tissue. These
provide energy and stimulate
metabolism. These are source of
enzyme needed for digestion.
Antibodies which are defence
against infections are protein in
nature. These maintain acid-base
balance.

Fundal height and gestation
is just
above symphysis pubis at
12 weeks gestation, at umbilicus
at 22 weeks and at xiphisternum
at 36 weeks.

Fungal infection of lung
is
generally opportunistic infection.
They develop in patients
with suppression of immune
status. It develops in chronic
congestion and edema where
fungi gets comfortable environment.
Histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis,
Cryptococcosis are
common diseases.

Furcation involvement
is the term
given when there is invasion or
bony destruction of bifurcation
or trifurcation of multirooted
tooth due to periodontal disease.
The bone loss around the each
tooth may be horizontal and
angular; furcation involvement
is a stage progressive periodontal
disease.

Furcation
refers to an area where
the root divides.

Furrow
refers to a groove.

Fusion
refers to union of two
separate tooth germs during
their formation. They may be
joined only by enamel and/or
dentin. Pulps may also be fused.
Extent of union depends on the
stage of development of teeth at
the time of fusion. Fused teeth
appear broader. They also
frequently exhibit incisal notch
or groove which may continue
on to the root surface. Whereas
fusion takes place at an angle
causing crooked appearance.
Pulpal anatomy: fused teeth tend
to have double pulpal space.
However, in both gemination
and fusion the pulp spaces may
or may not be separated.
Location in the jaw: Double teeth
in the mandible would almost
exclusively represent fusion
crowding: fused teeth occupy
less space than separate teeth
would, causing spacing in the
arch. In case of fusion there will
be reduction in tooth number.

G (Glabella) is the most
prominent anterior
point in the midsagittal
plane of the forehead.

Gabapentin is a drug
that is used in the
treatment of partial
seizures. It is a GABA
analogue. Its mechanism
of action occurs at calcium
channel. It is generally well
tolerated. It is well absorbed after
oral administration and is
eliminated by renal excretion.
Average half life is 5-7 hours.

Gag reflex
is seen at 18 1/2 week
of I.U. life. In the buccal cavity
and pharynx, the ectoderm/
endoderm zone is towards the
posterior third of the tongue.
Touching here elicits a gag reflex,
a protective reflex.

Gait
is the period between successive
points at which the heel of the same
foot strikes the ground. 60-65%
time of one cycle foot remains in
touch to the ground. Gait has four
components, antigravity support of
body, stepping, maintenance of
equilibrium and means of
propulsion.

Galactorrhea
refers to the bilateral,
spontaneous, multiple ducts, and
milky type of discharge in child
bearing age. It is caused by
increased production of prolactin
and is most commonly seen after
pregnancy. Normal levels of
prolactin range from 1 – 22 mg per
ml.

Galactosemia
is an inability to
metabolise galactose. It leads to
high blood and tissue galactose
level and galactosuria. Each one
of three types develops due to
deficiency of specific enzyme.
Classical galactosemia is due to
galactose – 1 phosphate uridyl
transferase deficiency. Manifestations
include cataract, cirrhosis
and mental retardation.

Gallium amalgam
is a product
formed by the reaction of an alloy
powder, silver-tin-copper with a
gallium based liquid alloy i.e.
gallium–indium–tin.

Galvanic current
refers to a current
of electricity produced by
chemical action between two
metals suspended in liquid.

Gardner’s syndrome
is
carcinomatous transformation of
adenomatous intestinal polyps.
There may be osteomas of jaw
and accompanying cysts are
indictors of Gardner’s syndrome
and bowel should be examined.

Gas gangrene
is caused by C
Perfrigens, C Histolyticum. Onset
is sudden with pain and swelling
in affected area, tachycardia and
hypovolemic shock. There
develops foul smelling blood
tinged discharge from wound.
Red fluid filled vesicles develop
around wound. Palpable crepitus
shows gas formation at the site.
Hemolytic jaundice and renal
failure are common. Radiograph
may show gas.

Gas lasers
(Helium and Helium-
Neon, HeNe, are the most
common gas lasers) have a
primary output of visible red
light. CO2 lasers emit energy in
the far infrared, and are used for
cutting hard materials.

Gastrointestinal bleeding
is the
most common cause including
gastric ulcer, gastric erosion
duodenal ulcer and esophagitis.
Red or coffee ground hematemesis
with or without malena
indicates upper G.I. bleeding.
Bright red rectal bleeding may be
due to lower G.I. bleeding. Signs
include hematemesis, gross occult
blood in stool. Hypotension
occurs in late cases. Tachycardia
develops earlier.

Gate control theory of pain
is still
the most accepted mechanistic
theory of pain. It was devised by
Melzack and Wall. According to
this theory noxious stimulation of
the Substantia Gelatinosa (SG)
functions as a gate control system
that modulates the afferent
pathways before they influence
the transmission cells. The
afferent patterns in the dorsal
column system therefore function
in part as a control trigger which
activates selective brain process
that influence the modulating
properties of the gate control
system.

Gated pulse mode
are periodic
alterations of the laser energy
being on and off, similar to a
blinking light. This mode is
achieved by the opening and
closing of a mechanical shutter in
front of the beam path of a
continuous wave emission. Duration
of on and off time normally
is as small as a few milliseconds.

Gates-Glidden burs
are elliptically
shaped burs with very long
shanks. These are used to retrieve
broken instruments and preparation
of post endodontic procedures.

Gaucher’s disease
is the most
common lysosomal storage
disorder (incidence 1 in 25,000
live births). Inheritance is
autosomal recessive, with a high
incidence seen in Ashkenazi Jews,
who have a carrier frequency of 1
in 60. There is a deficiency of
glucosidase, resulting in
accumulation of its substrate
glucocerebroside. The enzyme is
encoded on chromosome. There
are three types of Gaucher’s
disease. Type I - adult type, nonneuronopathic.
Type II - severe
infantile, rare, neurological signs
seen at 3 months, die by 2 years
of age. Type III - subacute,
neuropathic, variable presentation
from childhood to 70 years
of age.

Gel
is a colloidal system in which
the solid and liquid are continuous
phases. Gel is usually flexible.

Gelatine
is a sponge. It can be left
adherent to the bleeding surface.
It will be completely absorbed in
1-2 weeks. It can be used in
treatment of bleeding tooth
sockets.

Gemination
refers to a double teeth
originated from one tooth bud.
This is the result of incomplete
splitting. In case of gemination,
fused crowns exhibit mirror
image. Pulpal anatomy geminated
teeth usually have an undivided
pulp. Germinations are
more common in maxilla. Gemination
results in extra tooth hence
require more space thereby likely
to cause crowding. Fusion of normal
tooth bud with a supernumerary
would result in crowding.
Hence neither crowding nor
diastema seems decisive. Gemination
does not reduce the tooth
number.

Gene therapy
is a treatment of
inherited diseases by introducing
wild type copies of defective
genes causing the disorder into
the cells of affected individuals.

General anesthetics
are the drugs
having the capability to depress
excitable tissue at all levels of
CNS. There are different stages of
anesthesia, analgesia and respiratory
paralysis. Course of general
anesthesia includes three stages,
induction of anesthesia which is
the period in which concentration
of anesthetic agent in blood tissue
increases. During maintenance of
anesthesia operation is performed.
Anesthesia is controlled
to maintain constant depth of it.
Third stage is emergence from
anesthesia, cessation of anesthetic
agent ending with complete recovery
of reflexes.

General anesthesia
is a procedure
done by giving an inhalation drug
before a surgical procedure to
relieve the sensation of pain.

Generalize periodontitis
is said to
have occurred when more than
thirty percent of the areas
assessed in mouth demonstrate
the bone loss and loss of attachment.

Generalized aggressive periodontitis
usually occurs in the
individuals of below the age
group of thirty. Clinically there is
generalized interproximal attachment
loss affecting three permanent
teeth other than first molars
and incisors. The destruction
occurs is episodic in nature with
the period of advanced destruction
followed by the variable
stages of remission.

Generalized diffuse gingivitis
involves the entire gingiva.

Generalized gingivitis
is said to
occur where inflammation
involves the entire mouth (see
Figure on page 199).

Generalized infection
is an
infection which has spread
throughout the body.

Generalized marginal gingivitis
involves the gingival margins in
relation to all the teeth.

Generalized seizures
are the seizures
involving the whole body.
Grand mal epilepsy also known
as tonic clonic seizure and is the
most common form of seizures
disorder. This is produced by idiopathic
neurologic disorders or
may develop in a neurologically
sound brain; secondary to a systemic,
metabolic or toxic disturbance.
Causes include drug withdrawal,
menstruation, fatigue,
falling asleep or awakening. Neurologically
induced generalized
tonic clonic seizure usually last
about 2-3 minutes and seldom
more than 5 minutes, the entire
seizure – lasts 5-15 minutes.

Genetic theory
is one of the earliest
concepts of growth and development
put forward by Brodie.
Genetics is the science that studies
inheritance and expression of
inherited traits. Genetics is the
history of individual and biological
and temperamental effects
given in birth and development.

Geniculate neuralgia
is characterized
by pain in ear and anterior
tongue. Location of pain is similar
to sensory distribution of the
nerve i.e. external auditory canal,
posterior auricular region and the
soft palate. If motor root is also
involved then facial palsy may
develop. Pain is not too severe.
Short course of high dose steroid
therapy is beneficial.

Genital tubercles
are the tiny
bumps of bone in the anterior
region of mandible that serve as
attachment sites for genioglossus
and geniohyoid muscles. These
appear as radio opaque.

Geographic tongue
is also known
as migratory glossitis. It refers to
irregularly shaped, reddish areas
of depapillation. There will be
thinning of dorsal tongue
epithelium. There is spontaneous
development and regeneration of
affected area. There may be
associated fissured tongue.
Etiology of geographic tongue is
not clear. An immunologic
reaction is suggested. No
inheritance pattern is noted. The
disease is asymptomatic but some
may complaint of burning pain
and stinging. Clinically
irregularly shaped red patches
with white patterns look like a
map. Red patches are smaller to
start surrounded by a white rim.
Red patches go on enlarging and
regressing and pattern goes on
changing every week.

Geometric teeth
refer to non
anatomic posterior teeth.

Geotrichosis
is a fungal disease
caused by Geostrichum species.
Oral lesions are similar to
candidiasis or thrush. It is white,
velvety covering of the oral
mucosa. It may be isolated or
diffuse organisms are small rectangular
shaped spores 4 to 8 microns.

Gerber space regainer
is a space
regaining appliance where a
seamless orthodontic band or a
crown is selected for the tooth to
be distalized. This space regainer
consists of‘U’ shaped tubing and
a ‘U’ shaped rod that enters the
tubing. The rod is soldered or
welded on the mesial aspect of the
first molar to be moved distally.
The ‘U’ shaped wire or rod is
fitted into the tube, in such a way
that the base of ‘U’ rod contacts
the tooth mesial to the edentulous
area. Open coil springs of
adequate length are placed
around the free ends of the ‘U’
shaped rod and inserted into the
tubing assembly. The forces
generated by the compressed
open coil springs bring about a
distal movement of the first molar.

German measles
is an acute
specific fever characterized by
sub occipital and posterior
cervical glandular enlargement.
Macular rash starts on first day.
Fever is moderate with malaise.
Rash consists of small, pink,
discrete macule. Occasionally
patient may complain of joint
pain. There is typical enlargement
of lymph gland and mild coryza.

Germicides
refer to anything that
destroys bacteria.

Gerontology
is the scientific study
of factors affecting the normal
aging process and the effects of
aging.

Gerstmann’s syndrome
is a
combination of right left
disorientation finger agnosia and
constructional apraxia. Acalculia
and dyslexia are common.

Ghomphoses joint movements
are
minimal. Example includes teeth
and jaw.

Ghost teeth
are an unusual
developmental problem in which
one or several teeth in the same
quadrant shows marked reduction
in radiodensity. Very thin
enamel and dentin are present.
Such teeth if erupt are malformed
and non functional.

Giant cell epulis
is found of
gingival margin between teeth
anterior to permanent teeth.
Numerous multinucleate cells lie
via vascular stroma of plump
spindle shaped cells. It should be
excised with its gingival base and
underlined bone curetted.

Giant cell fibroma
develops from
fibrous connective tissue,
mandibular or maxillary gingiva
is mostly affected. Lesion is
pedunculated. It has papillary or
warty surface. Some may be
painless, smooth nodular growth.
Histologically multiple multinucleated
giant cells are seen.
Nuclei are large of giant cells.
Numerous small capillaries are
noted. Surgical excision is the line
of treatment.

Giant cell granuloma
is hyperplastic
than neoplastic. It is seen
in young person. There develops
painless swelling. It forms a
proliferating vascular connective
tissue packed with giant cells.
Fibroblastic proliferation and
prominent osteoid and bone
formation are common. Curettage
is sufficient although recurrence
follows incomplete removal.

Giardiasis
is protozoal infection of
small intestine caused by
flagellate Giardia Lamblia. Cysts
are transmitted as a faecal
contamination of water or food by
person to person contact. It may
result in acute diarrhea and
malabsorption. Incubation period
is 1-3 weeks. There may be
marked weight loss. Single dose
Tinidazole is effective in 90%
cases.

Gifford sign
is a resistance to
everting the upper eyelid.

Gingiva
is a masticatory type of
oral mucosal membrane that
forces the covering of the teeth. It
is divided into three zones for
descriptive purpose.

Gingival abscess
is a localized
purulent infection involving
marginal gingiva or interdental
papilla. It is a localized, painful
rapidly expanding lesion that is
usually of sudden onset. It is
generally limited to marginal
gingiva or interdental papilla. In
early stages, it appears as a red
swelling with a smooth, shiny
surface. Within 24 hr to 48 hr the
lesion usually become fluctuant
and pointed and forms a surface
orifice from which purulent
exudates may be expressed.

Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
is
the fluid which is present in
gingival sulcus. Sulcular fluid
Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
seeps into it from the gingival
connective tissue through the thin
sulcular wall. The gingival fluid
is believed to Cleanse material
from the sulcus, contain plasma
proteins that may improve
adhesion of the epithelium to the
tooth. It has antimicrobial
properties, exert antibody activity
in defense of the gingiva.

Gingival cyst
develops either in
free or attached gingiva. It may
develop at any age. It is a soft
tissue lesion and does not show
on radiographs; when bigger in
size, it may bulge the cortical plate
of bone. Otherwise it presents a
small well circumscribed painless
swelling of gingiva. It resembles
a superficial mucocele. Surgical
excision is the remedy.

Gingival fibers
are the connective
tissue of marginal gingiva which
are densely collagenous in nature
and mainly composed of type I
collagen. Their main function is
to hold the marginal gingiva
firmly, to provide rigidity so that
the tooth can withstand masticatory
forces and to unite marginal
gingiva with the cementum of the
root and adjacent attached
gingiva.

Gingival graft
is a surgical procedure
that removes gingival tissue from
one area of the mouth to place it in
another area of the mouth which is
deficient in gingiva.

Gingival groove
is the groove
separating the gum pad from the
palate.

Gingival hyperplasia
is an increase
in size of gingiva and soft tissue
that overfills the interproximal
spaces. Hyperplasia may be
inflammatory, noninflammatory
or mixed. In inflammatory
hyperplasia the enlarged gingiva
are soft, edematous and sensitive
to touch. While noninflammatory
is hard firm, dense and paler.

Gingival margin trimmer (GMT)
is a dental hand instrument
designed to bevel the cervical
cavosurface walls of the cavity
preparation.

Gingival overgrowth
can occur
due to variety of reasons that
indudes drugs such as
cyclosporin nifidipine and
calcium channel blocker. Tooth
brush trauma may cause localized
thickened gingiva with a more
linear appearance. Chronic
inflammation can cause firm,
rolled and fibrotic gingiva. Poor
oral hygiene can lead to chronic
inflammation and thickened
gingiva.

Gingival pocket
usually occurs
due to enlargement of gingival
tissue without any underlying
destruction of periodontal
tissues.
Gingival recession
refers to the
apical movement of gingiva. Histologically
there is thinning of
gingival tissue. Etiology of gingival
recession includes: Improper
brushing bone loss, peuodontion
trauma to occlusion and again.

Gingival sulcus
is the shallow
crevice or space around the tooth
bounded by the surface of the
tooth on one side, and the
epithelium lining, the free margin
of the gingival on the other. The
clinical determination of the
depth of the gingival sulcus is an
important diagnostic parameter.
It is V-shaped and under normal
physiological condition, it barely
allows the penetration of the
periodontal probe. The so-called
probing depth of a clinically
normal gingival sulcus in humans
is 2 to 3 mm. The sulcus depth
around the primary teeth is
comparatively greater those that
found around the permanent
teeth. The mean values range
from 1.4 mm to 2.1 mm.

Gingivectomy
refers to the excision
of the gingiva.

Gingivitis
refers to inflammation of
gingiva and may occur as acute
or in subacute form. Plaque or
plaque derived endotoxins act as
irritants. Food impaction and
general oral neglect may result it
Gingiva becomes deeper pink to
red as the hyperaemia and
inflammatory infiltrate develop.
Inflammatory swelling produces
a bulbous appearance. In chronic
gingivitis pus may be expressed
on pressure. Irritants are to be
removed.

Gingivodental fibres
are those
present on the facial, lingual and
interproximal surfaces. They are
embedded in the cementum just
beneath the epithelium at the base
of the gingival sulcus.

Gingivoplasty
refers to reshaping
of the gingiva, to create
physiologic gingival contours.
The procedure is performed with
the help of periodontal knife,
scalpel, rotary diamond stones or
electrodes.

Gland of Blandin and Nuhn
is the
anterior lingual gland lying close
to inferior surface and lip of
tongue. Five to seven of its ducts
open on small protuberances of
mucus membrane under the
tongue.

Glandular cheilitis
is not very
common and lower lip becomes
enlarged, everted and firm. Use
of tobacco and constant exposure
of sun may result it. Emotional
disturbance may also result in
glandular chelitis. There are three
types: Simple - these are multiple,
pin headed and painless lesions.
Superficial suppurative type - there
will be painless swelling,
crusting, induration and
superficial ulceration of lip. Deep
suppurative type – there is deep
seated infection with abscess and
fistula. Mucosal surface shows
numerous dilated salivary duct
orifices surrounded by a red
macular area. Person notes a
mucus secretion at the orifice of
duct. In severe form, lip is
considerably and permanently
enlarged and develops pain and
tenderness. Volkmann’s chelitis is
a severe form and epidermoid
carcinoma may be associated.
Vermilionectomy is the line of
treatment.

Glandular fever
is caused by
Epstein Barr Virus. Chiefly young
people are affected. Deep kissing
may transmit it. Person develops
fever, sore throat, headache and
lymphadenopathy. Cervical
glands enlarge to start with.
Pharyngitis and tonsillitis are
common. Some cases may be
symptomless. Oral lesion
includes gingivitis and stomatitis.
There may be occasional oral
ulcers and palatal petechiae.
Some may develop hemorrhagic
tendency. Blood may show
atypical lymphocytes. Abnormal
forms may be oval, horseshoe
shaped. Nuclei may be indented
and irregular. Thrombocytopenia
may be present. There is no
specific treatment of this disease.

Glasgow coma scale (GCS)
was
first described by Teasdale and
Jennett in 1974. This scale relates
the clinical observation under the
three categories: motor response,
verbal performance and eye
opening allowing any changes
over a period of time to be appreciated.

Glass blowers’ white patch
is a
variant of traumatic keratosis
affecting cheek and lip. Histologically
it resembles cheek and lip
bite.

Glass ionomer cements (GICs)
are
the one that consists of a basic
glass and an acidic water-soluble
powder that sets by an acid–base
reaction between the two components.
These cements bond
chemically to tooth and posses’
anticariogenic properties, Nonirritant
to the tissue, low thermal
diffusivity and biocompatible.

Glenoid fossa
is a concave
depressed area of the temporal
bone of which mandibular
condyle rest.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
is a type of filament
found in Glial cells surrounding
neurons.

Gliomas
are very common
measuring 50% intracranial neoplasms
of brain. Symptoms of
increased intracranial pressure
may get developed. Intellectual
decline, personality changes,
emotional liability, seizures and
headache may also over. Focal
lesions depend on the site of
lesion (see Figure on page 206).

Globulin zinc insulin
is most
active upto 8 hour following
subcutaneous injection and action
fades out by 18 hours.

Globulomaxillary cyst
is a well
defined pear shaped radiolucency
found between the roots
of maxillary lateral incisor and
cuspid. These are found within
the bone at the junction of
globular portion of medial nasal
process and maxillary process. It
is found accidentally being
symptom free. Radiographically
it appears as inverted pear shaped.

Glomerulonephritis
results in
hematuria, dysmorphic red cells,
casts and mild proteinuria.
Edema is found in periorbital and
serotal lesions Hypertension may
develop.

Gloss
is the optical property that
produces a lustrous appearance.
Luster is the proportion of
specular reflection to diffuse
reflection. When the incident beam
is scattered by the object there is
decrease in gloss. Gloss is an
important appearance property of
dental restorative material.

Glossopharyngeal nerve
is a ninth
cranial nerve having motor and
sensory part. Sensory fibres
supply posterior 2/3rd of tongue
and pharynx. Motor fibres supply
the stylopharyngeus muscle (see
Figure on page 207).

Glossopharyngeal neuralgia
is
neuralgia of 9th cranial nerve. Its
pain is paroxysmal but less severe
than trigeminal nerve pain.
Location of trigger zone and pain
sensation follows distribution of
the nerve. It includes posterior
tongue, pharynx and infra
auricular area. Pain is triggered
by chewing and swallowing
because all this stimulate
pharyngeal mucosa. Glossopharyngeal
neuralgia may be
associated with trigeminal
neuralgia. Sometimes it may be
associated with vagal symptoms.
Intra or extra cranial tumors may
compress cranial nerve.
Treatment is similar to trigeminal
neuralgia.

Glossy polymer
is an amorphous
polymer that behaves as a brittle
solid.

Gloves
are a disposable item that
gives protection to health care
worker through cuts and
abrasions. Gloves should be
changed for each patient. Surgical
gloves are not to be washed
before or after being used.

Glucometer
is a small instrument
that measures the amount of
glucose in capillary blood.

Glutraldehyde
It is a high level
disinfectant. 20 minutes immersion
in 2% alkaline glutraldehyde
solution for disinfection and 6-10
hours immersion for sterilization
of instruments is recommended.
It has a pungent odour, irritating
to eyes.

Glycerol
is a three carbon carbohydrate
which combines with
fatty acids to form triglycerides.

Glycogen
is also known as animal
starch. It is highly branched poly
saccharide similar to plant starch.
Glucose is stored in human body
as glycogen. When blood sugar
lowers down the glycogen is
converted in the liver to glucose.
Glucose released in blood restores
normal blood sugar levels.

Goitre is an enlargement of thyroid
occurring due to deficiency of
iodine leading to goitre which is
marked by swelling of the neck
with the enlargement of thyroid
gland. Babies born to these
mothers may be physically or
mentally deformed. Endemic
goitre is a public health problem.
Common salt fortified with small
quantities of sodium and
potassium iodate has been widely
used in reducing the prevalence
of goitre. A simple goitre secretes
low levels of thyroid hormones.
Other types of goitre hyper
secrete thyroid hormones and are
known as toxic goitre.

Gold filling
makes an excellent
filling material. It is most
malleable filling material
therefore it can be directly
inserted and adopted to cavity
wall. It brings hardness to cavity.
It is insoluble in oral fluids and
will not tarnish to corrode. It
maintains high polish.

Gold foil
takes longer to build up
than other gold filling materials
due to softness and lack of mass.
It can be used throughout the
cavity and is suitable as a surface
material. But it takes considerable
time to build up restoration.

Gold inlays
are used on amalgam
fillings. These are used where
teeth have lost cusps or otherwise
are too weak. Advantage of gold
is that is does not tarnish and has
great strength.

Gold
is used as the restorative
material. The pulp reaction to
gold crown is a result of type of
cement used to retain the
restoration. The condensation of
cohesive gold is a factor in pulp
response. Mild to severe response
is seen in 10-20 days. If a base in
required pulpal inflammation is
reduced. There are no irreversible
changes and use of cohesive gold
may be found biologically sound.
Gold foil shows the least marginal
leakage.

Golden proportion
is the
guidelines which dentists use in
determining the most esthetic
appearance of a particular tooth
(teeth need to maintain a certain
height to width ratio to look their
best.)

Gold-palladium alloys
were
introduced in 1970 and were
developed to avoid color change
due to silver. The only disadvantage
of the gold palladium group
is thermal expansion incompatibility
with some of higher expansion
porcelains. Otherwise
rigidity is increased and corrosion
resistance is excellent.

Gonial angle (A-Go-Me)
is the
angle formed by the tangents to
the body of the mandible and
posterior border of the ramus.
This not only expresses the form
of the mandible but also gives
information on mandibular
growth direction. If this angle is
acute the growth is horizontal.
This is a favorable condition for
anterior positioning of the
mandible with an activator. In
skeletally derived malocclusion,
a casual type of treatment is
possible only by channeling basal
growth pattern to provide the
morphologic and functional
changes needed to establish a
normal structural and functional
pattern.

Gonorrhea
is a venereal disease
generally affecting genito urinary
parts. Oral – genital sex affects
oral cavity. Lips may develop
acute painful ulceration. Gingiva
may become erythematous with
or without necrosis. Gonococcal
pharyngitis and tonsillitis are well
recognized lesions.

Good cholesterol
named HDL is
capable of transporting cholesterol
back to liver where it is
disposed. So it is called good
cholesterol and elevated levels are
helpful to heart.

Gout
may be primary or secondary.
Primary is inherited metabolic
disorder. There is hyperuricemia
resulting from over production or
under excretion of uric acid.
Depostis of urate crystals can
occur in subcutaneous tissues,
joints and kidneys. Secondary
gout results due to drugs i.e.
thiazides, frusamide or diseases
like lymphoma. Colchicines are
most effective agent when given
within 24 hours of acute attack.

Gracey curettes
is a periodontal
instruments that consists a set of
four mini – bladed curettes; the
sub 0 and number 1–2 are used
for anteriors and premolars,
number 11–12 are used for
posterior mesial surface and
number 13–14 are used for
posterior distal surface. The
length of blade is nearly half of
the conventional Gracey curette
and is slightly curved upwards
which helps in adapting the
instrument more closely to the
tooth surface (see Figure on page
210).

Grandmal seizures
are a type of
epileptic seizures involving
whole body. There is no aura but
sudden loss of consciousness with
falling to the ground is there. Cry
may be heard due to forced
expiration. Finally the muscles are
relaxed but patient remains
unconscious for some time.
Tongue biting and urinary incontinence
is not rare. Headache and
drowsiness may remain for a few
days.

Granulocytes
are the precursor and
mature form of leukocytes
characterized by neutrophilic,
eosinophilic or basophilic granulocytes
in their cytoplasm.

Granuloma gravidorum
is a
gingival lesions associated with
pregnancy. 30 to 40% women
show mild gingival enlargement.
Post delivery enlargement
subsides on its own.

Granuloma Inguinale
is caused by
Donovania Granualomatosis. It is
considered to be a venereal
disease. External genitalia are
affected more. Papule/nodule
ulcerates soon. Lips, buccal
mucosa or palate are affected.
Painful ulcerated lesions sometimes
bleed. Mucus membrane is
inflamed and edematous. Fibrous
scar formation may be extensive.

Granuloma
is described a type of
nodule which contains granulation
tissue. On gingiva it occurs
as a swollen mass.

Granulomatous chelitis
is also
known as Miescher’s syndrome of
unknown etiology. Young
females are more affected.
Histologically, there is focal non
caseating granuloma formation.
There will be epitheloid cells with
Langhans type of giant cells.
Lower lip is diffusely swelled up.
There may be fever, headache and
visual disturbances. Some may
develop scales, fissures and
pustules. Swelling is non pitting.
Swelling may be hard as rubber.
Regional lymph nodes may be
enlarged. It may be associated
with Melkerson Rosenthal
syndrome consisting of fissured
tongue and facial paralysis.
Differential diagnosis includes
angioedema and sarcoidosis.
Angioedema appears suddenly.
History of recurrence is there.
Sarcoidosis will be excluded by
absence of any other manifestation
and by a negative Kveim test.
It is managed by repeated
injection of corticosteroid every
few weeks and cheiloplasty.

Granulomatous hypersensitivity
is the most important form of
delayed hypersensitivity, causing
many of the pathological effects
in diseases, which involve, T-cell
mediated immunity. It results
from the presence within
macrophages of a persistent agent
usually a microorganism, which
the cell is unable to destroy. It
may also be due to presence of
immune complexes, which
results in ‘Epitheliod Cell
granuloma’ formation.

Grasp
is a precise control of movements
during the instrumentation
or performing any other dental
procedure.

Grasp reflex
means when the
body’s palms are stimulated the
hand closes. This is also a
corresponding plantar reflex. But
movements disappeare by
24 months of age.

Gray lesions
are not only due to
biologic pigment but also due to
the deposition of foreign material
in connective tissue. It may be
localized or diffuse. Color may be
due to amalgam particles
encountered in oral mucosa.
Diffuse gray pigmentation is seen
in silver, lead, and bismuth.

Green stain
appearance varies from
light or yellowish green to very
dark green. These stains are
generally embedded in the
bacterial plaque. Generally facial
one third of the maxillary anterior
teeth are involved. These stains
appears to be soft and is difficult
to remove. Stain of long standing
may cover a decalcified area of
enamel. No micro-organism has
been identified to stain green.

Green stick fracture
when only one
cortex is discontinued.

Greincspan’s syndrome
is a triad
of lichen planus, diabetes mellitus
and hypertension. It may
predispose to squamous cell
carcinoma.

Grit size
is a numerical grading of
particle size. Larger numbers
denote fine particles while small
numbers denote coarse particles.

Groove
refers to a long, narrow
depression.

Ground nut
is known as poor
man’s dry fruit. It contains about
25% proteins and 40% fat. It does
not contain vitamin C but contain
high quantity of thiamine and
nicotinic acid. In humid area it
may develop aflatoxin which is
harmful to body.

Ground substance (sol-gel colloidal system)
is an amorphous
matrix in which the connective
tissue cells and fibres of the pulp
are embedded. It is generally
regarded as a gel rather than a
solution and therefore is
considered to differ from tissue
fluids, because of its content of
polyelectric polysaccharides, the
extracellular matrix is responsible
for the water holding properties
of connective tissues. It occupies
the space between formed
elements.

Growth
according to Krogman
refers to increase in size change
in proportion and progressive
complexity.

Growth
according to Meridith refers
to entire series of sequential
anatomic and physiological
changes taking place from the
beginning prenatal life to senility.

Growth
according to Moss refers to
change in any morphological
parameter which is measurable.

Growth
according to Moyers refers
to quantitative aspect of biological
development per unit of time.

Growth
according to Todd refers to
an increase in size.

Growth curve
is a graphic
representation of the change in
size of a bacterial population over
a period of time, including a
phase of log phase, a stationary
phase and a death phase.

Growth field
can be explained as
follows i.e. the bone doesn’t grow
by generalized uniform deposition
of new bone on all outside
surface with corresponding
resorption from all inside surface
because of the topographically
complex nature of each bone’s
shape. The bone must have a
differential mode of enlargement.
Some of its parts and areas grow
much faster and greater extent.

Growth site
refers to fields that
have some special significance or
noteworthy role in growth
process are often called.

Growth spurts
refers to the periods
when sudden acceleration of
growth occurs. This sudden
increase in growth is termed as
growth spurts. The growth spurts
in the prenatal period and the
infantile period involves the
division of the cells. On the other
hand, the physiological alteration
in the hormonal secretion is
believed to be the cause of
pubertal growth spurts. The
timing of growth spurts differs in
boys and girls.

Gubernacular canal
refers to the
holes seen in a dry skull from
lingual to primary teeth in jaws
that represent openings of
Gubernacular cord.

Gubernacular cord
refers to the
connective tissue overlying a successional
tooth that connects with
the lamina propria of the oral
mucosa by means of a strand of
fibrous connective tissue that contains
remnants of dental lamina.

Gubernacular foramina
are the
small openings in mandible and
maxilla an evidence of eruption
pathways of permanent teeth.
Gubernacular foramina are sites
for Gubernacular cords.

Guillain Barre Syndrome
is caused
by progressive demyelinating
neuropathy. It is an autoimmune
following a non specific disease.
Impaired swallowing or
parasthesia of mouth and face is
the early sign. There may be ascending
anesthesia and paralysis
of legs and trunk. In severe case
respiration is compromised.

Gulland’s Sign
is a quick, flexion
of hips and knee in response to
pinching of the contralateral
quadriceps’s muscle. It indicates
meningeal irritation.

Gunning type splints
is a type of
intermaxillary fixation introduced
by Gunning in 1866 where
the vulcanite overlay of the natural
teeth which he used as a splint
for fractured dentate mandible.
Properly constructed gunning
splint should hold jaws in a
slightly over closed relationship
as the fracture of mandible are
effectively used in this position.
The splints are constructed in
acrylic resin and the fitting surface
is lined by black gutta percha.

Gustatory sense
refers to sense of
taste therefore called gustatory
sense and taste buds are special
organs of taste. Taste receptors
are located on tongue and are
known as chemoreceptor’s. Basic
taste sensations are sweet, salty,
sour and bitter.

Gutta percha
is clay like material
used in the filling of root canals.
The material is used due to its
stability and easy manipulation.
Material is inert so action is not
chemical one. Because it is put
after being heated, injury may be
thermal. It provides a poor seal
of the cavity margins hence saliva
may leak and irritate the pulp.

Habit
can be defined as
the tendency towards an
act that has become a
repeated performance,
relatively fixed,
consistent and easy to
perform by an
individual or habit
According to Buttersworth
(1961) it is a frequent,
constant practice or an acquired
tendency which has been fixed by
frequent repetition. Habit
according to Finn is an act, which
is socially unacceptable. Habit
according to Hogem boom (1953)
was also defined as the
methodical way in which mind
and body act as a result of the
frequent repetition of certain
definite set of nervous impulses.
Habit according to William James
(1972) is an acquired habit from a
psychological point of view, is
nothing but a new pathway of
discharge formed in the brain by
which certain incoming currents
tend to escape. Habit according to
Boucher (1982) was also defined as
a tendency towards an act that has
become a repeated performance
relatively fixed, easy to perform
and almost automatic.

Habitual cheek/lip biting
refers to
a more of a superficial lesion
produced due to constant trauma
by rubbing, sucking or chewing
H movements which abrade the
area of lip cheek. It does not
produce ulceration. These are
poorly macerated and reddened
areas. It is a subconscious nervous
habit.

Habitual mouth breathing
refers to
a condition where oral breathing
persists as habit even after the
removal of the nasal obstruction
or any other underlying etiology.
Interceptive procedures should
involve identification and
removal of the cause. Persistence
of habitual oral breathing is an
indication to use a vestibular
screen to intercept the habit.

Habitual tongue thrust
refers to a
condition where the tongue thrust
swallow is present as a habit even
after the cessation of the
malocclusion.

Hair papilla
refers to a small, cap
shaped cluster of cells located at
the base of follicle where hair
growth begins (see Figure on page
Habitual cheek biting 215).

Hair source
Hair from head is
usually long and soft and taper
gradually. Hair from female head
is thinner. Hair from beard and
moustache are usually thicker
than those from any part of body.
Hair from chest, axilla and pubic
region are short and thicker.
Pubic hair and from axilla show
split ends. Hair from eyebrows,
eye lashes and nostrils are stiff,
thick and bristly. Hair from body
surface is fine, short and flexible.
They don’t show pigment cells in
cortex. Medullary canal is small.
The fine downy hair of new born
infant has no medullary canal or
pigment cells.

Hairy leukoplakia
is highly
indicative of HIV infection.

Hairy tongue
is an unusual
condition characterized by
hypertrophy of filliform papillae
of tongue. Normally keratinized
surface layers of filliform papillae
are continuously desquamated
due to friction of food and
anterior upper teeth. These are
replaced by new epithelial cells
from below. When tongue
movements becomes restricted
during illness the papilla enlarges
and become heavily coated. The
color of papilla varies from
yellowish white-brown black
depending upon the type of
stains, the tongue is exposed to.
Longer papilla entangles food
particles of different colors.
Tobacco smoke colors it black.
Mid dorsum is first to be affected.
Dehydration and terminally ill
patients also develop thick
coatings. Nicotinamide deficiency
may produce black hairy tongue
in experimental animals.
Excessive exposure of radiation to
head and neck area and systemic
antibiotics may also produce
hairy tongue. Because the
condition is benign, the treatment
is also empirical, in such cases,
thorough scrapping and cleaning
of tongue is advised to promote
desquamation and removal of
debris.

Halitosis
in general means bad
breath, and is also known as oral
malodor. The term halitosis
originated from the Latin word
halitus, breath, and the Greek –
osis, meaning abnormal condition
Oral malodor is a common
complaint that may periodically
affect people of all age groups.

Halothane
is a non-irritating,
potent anesthetic agent which can
produce profound anesthesia
without hypoxia. Its induction
and recovery is quick. It is a poor
analgesic but is used in dentistry
with 70% N2O/30% O2 concentration.
Skeletal muscle is relaxed
and uterine contractions are
depressed. In dental practice it
relaxes the masseter muscle and
inhibits salivation. Laryngospasm
is inhibited Classical signs of
anesthesia are lacking.

Hamartomas
are tumor like
malformations. These are usually
congenital. Once achieved adult
dimensions these don’t increase in
size.

Hand Schuller Christian disease
occurs in early life. Oral manifestations
are often nonspecific. It
includes sore mouth, gingivitis
and suppuration. There develops
an unpleasant taste. Lesions in
skull are sharply outlined.
Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia
is often found. Prognosis is
good.

Hand, Foot and Mouth disease
is
an endemic disease of very young
children. There is formation of
maculo papular, exanthematous
and vesicular lesions of skin. Low
grade fever, lymphadenopathy,
diarrhea and vomiting develop.
oral manifestation includes small,
multiple vesicular and ulcerative
oral lesions. Hard palate, lips and
gingiva are involved. Intracytoplasmic
viral inclusions can be
shown in vesicular scrapings. No
specific treatment is needed.

Handpiece
Low speed hand pieces
upto 4000 revolutions a minute
are driven by a miniature
compressed air. Contrangle hand
piece is used because it provides
access to every tooth. Air turbine
hand pieces are driven at a speed
of 40,0000 revolutions a minute.
These are contrangled and are
used with a built in water spray
to counter act the heat generated
by high speed cutting. There is
abscence of vibration. Disadvantage
is of high pitched whistling
noise.

Hanging is a form of asphyxial
death produced by suspending
body with a ligature around the
neck. The constricting force is the
weight of the body. It takes a few
seconds when knot is over cricoid
cartilage and 1-2 minutes when it
is over larynx. Neck is found
stretched and elongated. Head is
always inclined to opposite side
of the knot. Face is pale but may
be swollen. Tongue is caught
between teeth, protruded and
bitten. Bloody froth may be seen
at mouth or nostrils. Hands are
often clenched. Escape of urine or
faces is often found.

Hard lasers (High level energy)
refer to thermal lasers emitted at
wavelength in the visible infra red
and UV range. Example: Er:YAG
laser ; Nd: YAG laser.

Hard palate
is the anterior portion
of roof of mouth.

Hardness
refers to a material’s
resistance to penetration when
indented by a hard material.
The hardness of dental material
is reported in Knoop hardness
number. Larger the indentation,
smaller will be the hardness
number. Enamel and porcelain
are two of the hardest material
and have highest numbers
Hardness of certain material is
enamel 350, dentine 60, Acrylic
resin 20, dental amalgam 100,
porcelain 450, Alloys 420.

Harmful habits
refers to those
habits that have a deleterious
effect on the teeth and their
supporting structures, such as
thumb sucking, mouth breathing,
tongue thrusting etc.

Harmonal sialadenosis
is
associated with menarche,
menses and pregnancy. Hypogenitatlism,
gynecomastia and
menopause may also cause it.
Diabetes results in retromandibular
enlargement of parotid.

Haversian canal
is a canal in bone
tissue containing nerve and blood
vessels surrounded by concentric
layers of calcified bone tissue (see
Figure on page 218).

Headache
is produced by stimulation
of pain sensitive structures
within the cranium or the extra
cranial tissues. Cranial bones are
insensitive. Within the skull
sensitive areas are meninges,
walls of venus sinuses and large
arteries. Most of the cerebral
substance itself is insensitive to
stimuli which are painful.

Headache of intracranial origin
is
due to inflammation, compression
and distortion of or
traction upon the pain sensitive
meninges and blood vessels
within skull.

Healing of fracture
refers to
formation of blood clot due to
damaged blood vessels in
medulla, cortex and periosteum.
Within 24 hours the hematoma is
converted into vascular, fibroblastic
granulation tissue. After
about 7 days cartilage and osteoid
tissues are laid down by osteoblasts.
It forms callus. Provisional
callus is converted into normal
bone. After a period of time bone
is moulded by osteoclasts and
osteoblasts.

Health history
is a structured format
and must be recorded as it is.

Health promotion
is the science of
art of helping the lifestyle of
individuals and society to attain
optimal health.

Health
refers to state of complete
physical, mental, social and
spiritual well being not merely
the absence of disease.

Hearing acquity
is the ability to
hear and identify the sound.

Heart attack
is expressed by
sudden onset of a severe crushing
pain across the chest pain and
may radiate to shoulder, left arm
and jaw. It is caused by coronary
heart disease.

Heart block
is a blockage of
impulse conduction from atria to
ventricles so that the heart beats
at a slower rate than normal.

Heat capacity
is the amount of
energy it takes to raise the
temperature of that object by one
degree. Some metals require
more energy than others.

Heat cramps
develop in those who
are doing heavy muscular work
in high temperature and
humidity. There are painful and
spasmodic contractions of calf
muscles. Sodium chloride level in
blood goes down.

Heat cure silicone
is the dental
material. Advantages include
adequate bond strength to acrylic
resiliency and more resistant to
aqueous environment. Disadvantages
include low tear strength
and poor resistance abrasion.

Heat cured acrylic denture base
is
the denture base material used for
fabricating denture. It has a good
appearance with high glass
transition temperature, easy
fabrication, low capital cost and
good surface finish. But it has low
impact strength and fatigue life is
too short.

Heat exhaustion
is a mild form due
to failure of thermo regulation. It
is a mild form of heat stroke. It is
due to inadequate replacement of
water and salt lost in perspiration
due to thermal stress. Body
temperature does not go very
high. Symptoms include dizziness,
weakness and fatigue. Heat
exhaustion is said to have occurred
when attack is gradual and
patient feels giddiness, nausea
and anorexia. Headache is of
throbbing character, but patient
remains conscious. Heat
exhaustion is caused by dehydration
and salt deficiency, sweating
may cause a fluid loss of 3 to 4
litres per hour.

Heat of fusion
is the amount of
energy required to melt a
material.

Heat of vaporization
is the amount
of energy required to boil a
material.

Heat sterilizing
refers to the use of
an autoclave or dry-heat sterilizer
to kill all potential diseasecausing
agents that remain
following patient treatment. Any
instruments that is not heat stable
and cannot tolerate high temperatures
should be thoroughly
cleaned and soaked in disinfectant
chemicals.

Heat stroke
is said to have occurred
when there is feeling of heat,
headache confusion, disorientation,
emotional bursts, giddiness and
vomiting. Excessive thirst may be
felt. Temperature of body may
arise up to 106° F. Face will be
flushed and pupils dilated. When
in shock, hypotension,
tachycardia and hurried respiration
will set in. Urine becomes
scanty. Heat cramps occur due to
loss of sodium chloride.

Heat syncope
is a mild effect of hot
environment. Person standing in
sun becomes pale, his B.P. falls
and he collapses suddenly. There
is no rise in body temperature.

Heath education
is a communication
activity aimed at enabling
individuals to achieve positive
health.

Heck’s disease
is focal epithelial
hyperplasia described by
Archard Heck and Stanely in
1965. It presents as multiple
nodular lesion with a sessile base
on lower lip, buccal mucosa and
tongue. Nodular lesions are of
1-5 mm in diameter, soft in
consistency of buccal mucosa.
There is spontaneous regression
after 4-6 months. It does not
require any treatment.

Hemangioendothelioma
is a
malignant angiomatous neoplasm
of mesenchymal tissue. It
is more common in younger age
group. Oral lesions are not very
common. It is a fast enlarging.
There is presence of localized,
nodular, painful swelling. Surface
ulceration is present. Teeth
become mobile and bleed on
pressure. Jaw shows destruction.
Lesion is expansible with cortical
expansion. It is angiomatous in
origin. Lips, palate and gingiva
may be involved. Endothelial
cells are seen. Lesion is firm,
round and nodular. When
vascular it looks reddish. These
grow fast. Surgical excision and
radiotherapy is the treatment.

Hemangioma
develops due to
proliferation of blood vessels.
There is variety of hemangiomas.
It appears as a flat or raised lesion
of mucosa. Lips, tongue and
buccal mucosa are commonly
involved. Central hemangioma of
maxilla or mandible occasionally
occurs. It may be by birth. In oral
cavity these frequently occur.
These are raised, red/blue/
purple lesions. Lesions are raised,
but are easily blanched on
pressure. These are soft and
pulsatile. Capillary hemangioma
are characterized by small,
numerous, endothelial lined
pyogenic granuloma. Cavernous
hemangioma reveals large,
irregularly shaped, dilated
endothelial lined sinuses. Such
blood pooled sinuses are
communicating with each other.
These lack muscular coat. Local
excision is the treatment. In case
of large lesion sclerosing agents
may be given earlier to reduce the
size.

Hemangioma of tongue
is a
painless and slowly growing
swelling of tongue. It is diffuse
and bluish in color. It is
compressible extending into floor
of mouth and cheek.

Hematoma
refers to a collection of
pooling blood.

Hematopoiesis
is the process by
which blood cells grow, divide
and differentiate in bone marrow.
There are three general classes of
blood cells derived from a pool
of pluripotent hematopoietic stem
cells (HSC), which reside in the
marrow and have the unique
ability to give rise to all of the
different mature blood cells types:
RBC, Platelets and WBC.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)
are defined by their abilities to self
renew throughout life and give
rise to committed progenitors that
can differentiate along all of the
possible hematopoietic lineages.
HSC are self-renewing cells;
when they proliferate, some of
their daughter cells remain as
HSC, so they are not depleted.
HSC daughter cells can commit
to any of several alternative
differentiation pathways that lead
to production of one or more of
types of blood cells. Progression
along these pathways is coupled
to cell division. The more mature
forms greatly outnumber the less
differentiated precursors. Most
types of hematopoietic cells lose
their replicative capacity altogether,
by the time they are fully
mature and are said to be terminally
differentiated. Progressively
HSC initially commit to one of
three main alterative different
pathways or lineages. The most
primitive cell in each lineage called
‘Lineage committed progenitors’.

Hematospermia
is the presence of
blood in the ejaculate resulting
from inflammation of prostate or
seminal vesicle. Blood in initial
portion of ejaculate suggests
involvement of prostate while
terminal hematospermia implies
seminal vesicle origin.

Hemiplegic gait
is a spastic gait in
which only one leg is involved.
Spasticity does not allow leg to
flex freely at hip, knee and ankle.
Leg rotates outwards and makes
a semicircle. Each leg is advanced
slowly. Scissors gait is noted. It is
the manifestation of cerebral
diplegia, ischemic brain damage
and compressive myelopathy.

Hemisection/Bicuspidization
is
the splitting of two rooted tooth
into two separate portions.

Hemiseptum
can be described as
one–wall bony defect.

Hemochromatosis
is a iron storage
disease and is of two types. One
is idiopathic and secondary form.
Normal body contains 2 to 4 gram
of iron when it reaches 15-40 gram
clinical signs and symptoms of
hemochromatosis appear. There
is slow progressive enlargement
of liver with fibrosis and ending
up in cirrhosis. Hemosiderin
deposit in skin gives slate gray
color. Cardiac arrhythmia and
heart failure may develop. Serum
ferritin may go > 300 mg/L.

Hemolysin
is a destruction of red
blood cells in such a manner that
hemoglobin is released.

Hemolysis
refers to destruction of
RBC Jaundice caused by
hemolysis often have known
sickle cell disease, G6PD
deficiency or other hemoglobinopathies.
Hemolysis can be
induced by infection, acidosis or
drug abuse. Symptoms include
fatigue, weakness, light headedness,
dyspnea on exertion, upper
abdomen pain and nocturnal
hemoglobinuria. Person will
develop pallor, jaundice and
splenomegaly.

Hemolytic anemia
is said to have
occurred when the circulating red
blood cell lacking a nucleus is
unable to synthesize protein for
growth and repair. It may be
inherited or acquired. Destruction
may be episodic or continuous.
Reticulosis is a clue to disorder.
Hemolysis increases the indirect
bilirubin. Serum LDH levels are
strikly elevated. Hereditary
causes include thalassemia,
hereditary spherocytosis, sickle
cell anemia, acquired autoimmune
hemolysis and Erythroblastosis
fetalis. Certain chemical
agents can also damage to RBC’s.
Clinical features include pallor,
weakness and fatigability;
Jaundice, dyspnea may also
occur. Oral Manifestations
include pallor of oral mucosa,
discoloration of teeth in the event
of erythroblastosis. Blood hemoglobin
level goes down to 10 mg/
dL and average survival of RBC
comes down to 12 days instead of
120 days. Reticulocyte count is
raised. Treatment includes blood
transfusion in severe cases,
splenectomy in cases of spherocytosis.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome
For
1 to 10 days develops anuria.
Patient may develop diarrhea,
abdominal pain, purpura and
fever. BP may be high with edema
and hematuria.

Hemopericardium
refers to the
presence of blood and blood
stained fluid in the pericardial sac.
Causes include transmural
myocardial infarct, ruptured
aneurysm of aorta and penetrating
injuries. When bleeding is
rapid death may take place.
Treated pericardium may
produce thickening of pericardium
and adhesions.

Hemophilia
is a sex linked
recessive disease characterized by
a prolonged coagulation time and
hemorrhagic tendencies. It is due
to deficiency of plasma proteins
needed for conversion of
fibrinogen to fibrin. It is a sex
linked recessive trait. It is of two
types: Hemophilia A, classic
hemophilia, Hemophilia B,
Christmas type. Hemophilia type
A is caused by deficiency of
clotting factor called factor VIII.
Type B or Christmas disease is
less common. This defect is due
to defect in Factor IV. In type C
there is less severe bleeding and
is due to deficiency of factor IX.
Disease is hereditary. Hemorrhage
into subcutaneous tissues,
joints and some internal organs
are common. Hemorrhage from
many sites in oral cavity is seen.
Gingival hemorrhage is massive.
Serious bleeding may occur from
umbilical cord. Easy bruising and
prolonged bleeding occurs with
spontaneous bleeding in subcutaneous
tissue. Fatal Epistaxis may
develop rarely. Gastric bleeding
from ulcer may develop. Spontaneous
intracranial hemorrhage
may develop. Gingival tissue may
bleed after extraction, recurrent
sub periosteal hematoma of jaw
may develop, High caries index,
with severe periodontal disease.
Dental extraction remains
problematic and should be done
with lot of caution.

Hemoptysis
refers to coughing of
blood. It may be in the form of
frank hemorrhage. Commonest
cause is tuberculosis and
pneumonia. Frank blood
indicates rupture of blood vessels.
It has to be differentiated from
hematemesis.

Hemorrhoids
refers to varicosities
of the hemorrhoidal venous
plexuses. Commonest place to
occur is anal sphincter. These may
be caused by increased
intrabdominal pressure as in
pregnancy, rectal tumours and
constipation.

Hemostasis
is arrest of bleeding.

Hemostat
is a multipurpose
instrument. It is to clamp blood
vessels that may be severed
during surgery. Narrow beaks
are serrated and handles have
locks. It can be used to grasp
unwanted tissue which are to be
removed during surgical
procedure. Different shapes and
sizes are available.

Hepadnaviruses
are small, spherical
DNA viruses causing hepatitis,
chronic, liver infections and liver
cancer. Their mode of transmission
along with blood is via saliva too.

Heparin
is found in large amount
in mast cells of liver and lung. It
is a strongest organic acid in
body. It is released with histamine
in anaphylactic shock. It prevents
the conversion of prothrombin to
thrombin. It may also decrease the
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.

Hepatic encephalopathy
is a life
threatening disorder. It causes
mild personality changes and
slight tremor. Person becomes
lethargic with aberrant behavior.
Lastly patient becomes stuporous
and hyperventilation sets in. There
may develop bradycardia,
decreased respiration and seizures.

Hepatitis A virus
is non enveloped
27 nm RNA virus enterovirus
group. It is excreted in feces and
transmission is by fecooral route.
The antibody to HVA is detected
during first week of infection and
IgM type. Incubation period
varies from 2-6 weeks. Nausea,
vomiting, loss of appetite
precedes 1-2 weeks. Dark urine
and stool may be noticed. Liver
is enlarged and becomes soft.
During recovery appetite
improves. Management includes
restrictions of fat and increased
glucose intake. B complex
supplements help.

Hepatitis B
is a 42 nm DNA virus
with 3 antigenically distinct
components. HBsAg can be
detected in blood during
prodrome and remains during
the entire icteric phase. The
spread is by infected blood, blood
products, and breast milk.
Incubation period lasts six weeks
to six months.

Hepatitis C
90% cases are of post
transfusion hepatitis. Hepatitis C
virus is a single stranded RNA
virus. It has properties similar to
falvi virus. No vaccine is
available. Treatment of HCV is
with low dose alpha interferon
with 30-50% success over 3-12
months. After treatment relapse
is very common.

Hepatitis G
is closely related to
HCV and is transmitted through
blood. Blood donors suffer most
upto 1-3%. Not much is known
about it because it does not cause
any specific disease.

Hepatocellular carcinoma
arises
from parenchymal cells. It is
associated with cirrhosis in
general and hepatitis B and C in
particular. Liver becomes tender
with palpable mass. Friction rub
over tumor may be heared. There
will be anemia with leucocytosis.

Hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis
appear as white,
spongy macerated lesions of
buccal mucosa. These are present
on floor of mouth, tongue,
gingiva and palate. There may be
white plaques overlaying the
cornea producing blindness.
Buccal mucosa exhibit thickening
of epithelium with pronounced
hydropic degeneration. Hereditary
Benign Intraepithelial Dyskeratosis
is also known as Witkop –
von sallman syndrome. It is an
autosomal dominant trait. Patient
shows oral mucosal thickening
plaques occur on bulbar conjunctiva.
Histologically peculiar
intraepithelial dyskeratosis, in
addition to acanthosis is seen. Cell
with in cell phenomenon occurs.

Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)
is caused by remarkably
reduced levels of hepatic fructose-
1-phosphate aldolase, which
splits fructose-1-phosphate into
two 3-carbon fragments for
further metabolism. Persons
affected with this rare metabolic
disorder have learned to avoid
any food that contains fructose or
sucrose, because the ingestion of
these foods can cause nausea,
vomiting, malaise, tremor,
excessive sweating, and coma due
to fructosemia. Most of the
symptoms are due to a secondary
hypoglycemia. These persons live
quite comfortable on other foods
(glucose, galactose, and lactosecontaining
foods like milk, bread,
dairy products, rice, and noodles).
Although there have been only a
limited number of cases reported
in the literature, the dental caries
prevalence in these subjects has
been extremely low.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telagnietasia
are characterized by
multiple round or oval purple
papules. The size is below 0.5 cms
in diameter. Number may even
be one hundred. Purple papules
are seen on lips, tongue and
buccal mucosa.

Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia
is an autosomal dominant
disorder. Whole of the oral
mucosa is involved and oral
lesion is a fiery red. Gingival and
hard palate are commonly
involved. Fissured tongue is seen.

Herpe’s Zoster
is an acute
infectious viral disease. It is very
painful and of incapacitating
nature. Virus causing it is similar
to chicken pox. General malaise,
pain and tenderness along with
the involved sensory nerve are
the symptoms. Often trunk is
affected. Patient has a linear
popular or vesicular eruption of
the skin or mucosa supplied by
affected nerves. It is unilateral and
dermatomic in distribution. It
may affect face due to infection
of Trigeminal nerve. Extremely
painful buccal mucosal lesions
occur. Antiviral drugs are to be
continued.

Herpengina
is a viral disease of
summer caused by coxsackie
group of virus. Symptoms are
mild and of short duration. It
includes sore throat, headache,
vomiting and abdominal pain.
Small ulcer shows greyish base
and inflamed periphery. There
may develop fever, pain and
enlargement of lymph glands.
Lymphocytosis is constant.
Disease spreads from one person
to another. No treatment is needed
as the lesion is self limiting.

Herpes labialis
may be caused by
common cold and febrile
injection. Prodromal paresthesia,
burning sensation and then
erythema develops. Vesicles form
after an hour or two. Vesicles
enlarge, coalesce and weep
exudates. After 2 days these rupture
and coalesce. Aciclovir cream
helps.

Herpes simplex
is a viral infection
occuring in, patients on immune
suppressed drugs are most likely
to develop chronic oral ulcers. On
these response of T lymphocytes
changes. There is formation of
small, round, symmetric lesions
associated with recurrent herpes
infection. Lesions last from weeks
to months. Larger lesions have
raised white borders of small
vesicles.

Herpetic conjunctivitis
is a serious
disease because it may cause
blindness.

Herpetic whitlow
is a lesion
generally present on finger can be
transmitted through saliva.
Incubation period is 2 to 12 days.
It causes tingling, fever, chills and
general malaise. Infected area
becomes red and swollen with
severe pain.

Herpetiform aphthae
are multiple,
painful, recurrent mouth ulcers.
Ulcers are multiple; shape is
irregular with ill defined edges.
Floor is grey. Size is small up to 1
to 3 mm.

Heterodont
refers to different types
of teeth within the same dentition
i.e. Incisors, canines, molars.

Heterograft
is graft obtained from
another species. Usually porcine
skin is used .Though used very
rarely because it is very expensive.

Hexachlorophene
is an anti
bacterial, bacteriostatic effect. It is
used as presurgical scrub. It has
been incorporated in tooth paste.

Hiatus hernia
is a sliding type
stomach with esophago gastric
junction slides upwards through
the hiatus into chest. In
paraesophageal type esophagogastric
junction is fixed below the
diaphragm and a part of stomach
herniates through the hiatus
besides the esophagus. There will
be retro sternal chest pain
especially on stooping or lying
down soon after meals. Nocturnal
regurgitation may cause chocking
attacks.

Hierarchy of needs
is a theory
given by Maslow in the year 1954
believed in self-actualization
theory, i.e., the need to
understand the totality of a
person. The general requirements
were arranged in a hierarchy. If
one basic requirement is satisfied
then next one emerges in the
order. The desire for the most
basic biologic needs to the more
psychological ones becomes
secondary after basic needs have
been satisfied. Motivation is
constantly required and is a never
endings, fluctuating complex
present in almost all organisms.
Pain avoidance, tension reduction
and pleasure acts as source of
motivating behavior.

High copper alloy
is a dental alloy
with a relatively high copper
content by 10% weight. It is a
corrosion free.

High gold alloys
are composed
principally of gold and platinum
group metals with minor addition
of tin, indium and iron. Gold
content is 78 to 87% by weight.
Tin, indium and iron are added
to promote a good porcelain
bond. The alloy is light yellow in
color. Corrosion resistance of gold
alloy is excellent.

High risk patients
are the patients
where the frequency of infectious
disease is higher. High risk
patients groups include patients
requiring frequent blood
transfusions, patients of renal
dialysis units and immune
deficient individuals. Intravenous
drug users are also at risk.

to sealants and restorative areas
with sealant and restorative
material that interferes with
occlusion.

High voltage burns
are the
electrical burns that are caused by
contact with high voltage electric
lines ranging from 10,000 to
32,000 volts. The tissues are so
extensively and rapidly damaged
that they usually involve
amputation of a limb either partly
or completely. In these cases the
damage actually extends into the
normal tissues quite proximal to
the apparently affected areas. This
is to be kept in mind while doing
amputation that the level of
amputation can be higher than
what is planned because of
proximally damaged muscles
below the normal skin.

High-stepping gait
is adopted to
avoid tripping from the toes
catching the ground. It develops
when there is weakness of
extensor muscles of feet as in
perineal nerve palsy.

that acts as a vasodilator and
increases the permeability of the
small blood vessels and functions
as a central nervous system
neurotransmitter.

occurring in bone marrow, spleen
and liver. Lesions around jaw are
common. Localized destructive
lesion occurs. Tooth buds may be

nodular, ulcerative or vegetative
lesions on buccal mucosa, tongue
palate or lips. Ulcerated areas are
covered by gray membrane.

slowly. Cervical lymph glands
may be enlarged and firm.
Culture of infected tissue may
give appropriate diagnosis.
Treatment includes Ketoconazole
for 6-12 months.

occurs in AIDS subject. It is less
common than encephalopathy. It
may develop due to methyl
group deficiency and is of 3 types.

degeneration restricted to
gracile tracts has also been
known. Finally HIV specific multi
nucleate giant cell infiltration is
seen in brain in HIV encephalopathy
and may extend to spinal
cord.

tongue and palate may be
affected.

Ho: YAG lasers
has solid active
medium, a crystal of YAG doped
with Holmium. Fiberoptically
delivered in contact with the
tissue in free-running pulsed
mode. Wavelength is 2120 nm. Ho
laser has little affinity for
pigmented tissue; its hemostatic
ability is decreased because of its
lower absorbency into hemoglobin
and other similar
pigments. Absorbency by tooth
structures is low. Frequently used
for arthroscopy surgery on the
TMJ.

dentition.

Homograft
is obtained from any
other human being except the
patient himself. Usually the
patient’s own relatives are chosen
as donors, i.e. the best donors
being siblings followed by the
parents. However, fresh
cadaveric skin can also be used if
prior permission has been taken.
In such donors, HIV and HBsAg
is tested prior to donation as the
contraindications for homograft
use in hepatitis, AIDS and
disseminated fungal infections.
Usually fresh skin is used but skin
stored for less than 2 weeks can
also be used. Older skin can be
used in early phases of wound
debridement and preparation for
auto grafting. A good ‘Take ’of
homograft is a good test for
wound readiness to accept auto
graft.

Hopewood house children
is the
study done to assess the dental
status of childhood between 3 and
14 years of age residing at
Hopewood House, Bowral, New
South Wales, longitudinally for 10
years. All lived on a strictly
institutional diet that, with the
exception of an occasional serving
of egg yolk was entirely vegetable
in nature and largely raw. Except
for weekends between-meal
snacks were limited to milk, fruit,
and raw vegetables. The dental
caries prevalence in young
children in Hopewood House
was almost negligible in the
primary dentition, and approximately
one tenth that seen in the
permanent teeth of the average
Australian child. A total of 25 out
of 82 children remained caries
free over a 5-years study period.

Horizontal bone loss
is a bone loss
that occurs in a plane parallel to
the cementoenamel junction of
adjacent teeth.

Horizontal brush scrubis
The
technique of tooth brushing
commonly used. But unlimited
scrubbing motion exerts pressure
on the facial tooth prominence. It
result in gingival recession,
gingival and tooth abrasion.

Horizontal fibres
extends at right
angles to the long axis of the tooth
from cementum to alveolar crest.

Horizontal mattress suture
is often
used for the interproximal areas

spaces to properly adapt
the interproximal papilla against
the bone. The horizontal mattress
suture can either be incorporated
with continuous, independent
sling suture (see Figure on page
230).

air produced in an electrically
heated oven called hot air
sterilizer. Contents are kept at
160° C for two hours. It is utilized
for sterilizing large batches of
instruments overnight. Root canal

sutured if needed. Socket is then
kept undisturbed.

Humerus
is the second largest bone
of body. It is a long bone of arm.

Humidity
is always present in
atmosphere. It depends on air’s
temperature. If the air is cooled
excessive moisture precipitates
which is known as dew point for
that temperature.

Humor’s theory
statics that the
ancient Greeks considered that a
person’s physical and mental
constitution was determined by
the relative proportions of the
four elemental fluids of the bodyblood,
phlegm, black bile, and
yellow bile which corresponds to
the four humors–sanguine,
phlegmatic, melancholic and
choleric. All diseases, including
caries could be explained by an
imbalance of those humors.

Humoral immunity
is the one in
which antibodies play the
predominant role.

by choreoattetatic moments,
personality changes and progressive
dementia. Symptoms appear
between 35 to 40 years of age.

musculature. Person drops the
objects. Walking is associated
with more brisk arm and leg
movements.

Hurler syndrome

millimetre in addition to fine
sized particles.

Hydatid cyst of liver
for two
species of cystodes echinococcus
granulaosus and echinococcus
mulitlocularis human being act as
intermediate host. Hydatied cyst
of E.granulosus is usually solitary
involving right lobe of liver, while
E. multilocularis is having
germinal membrane which
permits formation of new cysts on
its outer surface. Renal involvement
produces lumbar pain and
hematuria. Calcification occurs in
40% cases. Eosinophilia is usual.
Complement fixation and indirect
hemagglutination tests are
positive.

Hydro densitometry
is a method of
measuring body composition.
Body mass divided by body
volume reflects the body’s fat
content. Body density can be
estimated by dividing its mass in
air by a volume obtaining its mass
in air by a volume obtained by
weighing a subject both in air and
under the water.

Hydro phosphate cement
is an
innovation of compounding of
zinc phosphate cement the mixing
of dehydrated dihydrogen
phosphate of zinc calcium and
other materials. These cements
have no marked advantage over
the conventional zinc phosphate
material.

Hydrogen peroxide
is an unstable
compound. It breaks down to
yield to give water and oxygen.
Its antibacterial effect is brief and
is useful in mouthwashes against
ulcerative gingivitis. Ten volume
of hydrogen peroxide with equal
amount of water is useful in
debridement of root canals
during root canal therapy.

Hydronephrosis
refers to the
dilatation of renal pelvis resulting
into atrophy of parenchyma. It
may be congenital or acquired. It
can be unilateral when condition
involves the renal pelvis and a
ureter, while those involving
bladder outlet and urethra
hydronephrosis can be bilateral.
Bilateral hydronephrosis leads to
renal failure and uraemia. Kidney
may be massively enlarged. One
or both ureters may be enlarged
depending on level of obstruction.

is the
preparation containing specific
antibodies used to prevent disease
after exposure to a pathogen.

Hyper kinesis
refers to excessive
motility.

Hyperactive pulpalgia
is characterized
by short, sharp shock. It is
never spontaneous. Pain is of
short duration so long irritant is
there-may be cold or hot, sweet
or sour. Icecream excites the
nerve in teeth and pain is referred
to eyes. Hyperactive pulpalgia is
common following the placement
of new restoration. Patients also
complain this after curettage. It
may be associated with caries of
tooth. Fractured teeth are more
hyper reactive. In maxillary
sinusitis maxillary teeth are
involved.

Hypercalcemia
refers to the
increased levels of calcium in
blood. In mild cases it may be
asymptomatic. Person may
develop constipation and
anorexia. In moderate high person
develops polyuria, nocturia and
polydipsia. In severe high cases
person develops emotional
liability, confusion, delirium and
psychosis. In late stage acute renal
failure may develop.

Hypercementosis
refers to
deposition of excessive amount of
secondary cementum on root
surfaces. It covers the entire root
area. It may be caused by
accelerated elongation of a tooth
inflammation, tooth repair and
osteitis deformans. It shows no
signs and symptoms. Cemental
spikes may be seen. There is no
increase or decrease of sensitivity.
Radiographically bulging and
thickening of rods is noted. No
treatment is indicated.

Hyperdontia
is the presence of
extra teeth beyond the normal
complement. Also refer supernumerary
teeth.

Hyperemia
is an increased blood
flow in the pulp. The increased
pressure against the sensory
nerve endings in the pulp
produce the sensation associated
with hyperemia. It will explain
why the pain appears to be of
different intensity and character
with application of cold or heat,
the cold producing hypersensitivity
response and the heat
producing true transient hyperemia.

Hyperkalemia
is recognized by
increased levels of potassium. It
may be the result of extensive
tissue breakdown, severe
dehydration, or excessive amount
of potassium. Symptoms include
numbness, mental confusion,
cold skin and disturbed cardiac
rate.

Hypermangesemia
refers to the
increased serum levels of
magnesium in acute and renal
failure. Deep tendon reflexes are
lost and necrosis, hypotension,
respiratory paralysis occurs with
serum level 10 mEq/L. Treatment
includes 100-200 mg of calcium.

Hyperocclusion
is when occlusal
surface of a tooth or restoration is
raised above the occlusal plane of
the teeth in arch.

Hyperparathyroidism
refers to
excess of circulating parathyroid
hormone. Bone and kidney are
the target organs. Serum calcium
level is elevated. Clinical features
include emotional instability,
painful bones and joints, crampy
abdomen, bowing of long bones,
pigeon chest, collapse vertebra,
muscle weakness, fatigue,
polyuria and polydipsia. Radiological
Features include Ground
glass appearance, moth eaten
appearance with varying
intensity, punctate and nodular
calcification may develop in
kidney and joints, pepper pot
skull due to osteopenia, Teeth
may become mobile and migrate,
Loss of lamina dura which may
be complete or partial.

Hyperpituitarism
result due to
hyperfunction of the anterior lobe
of pituitary gland producing
growth hormone. Before closing
of epiphysis, gigantism occurs
and after closure, acromegaly. In
this condition, bone overgrowth
and thickening of soft tissue
causes a coarsening of facial
features. Head and feet become
large with clubbing of toes and
fingers. There will be enlargement
of sella turcica, paranasal
sinuses and thickening of outer
table of skull. Angle between
ramus and body of mandible is
widened. There is enlargement of
inferior dental canal. Radiograph
will show increased tooth size
specially of root due to secondary
cemental hyperplasia. Oral
manifestations include prominent
mandibular condylar growth,
Overgrowth of mandible leading
to prognathism, Lips become
thick like Negro’s, Teeth become
more spaced, Body and root may
be longer than normal.

Hyperplasia
is defined as an
increase in number of cells in a
tissue or organ. Pathological
hyperplasia is common in oral
cavity. Increase in number of
epithelial cells and increased
thickness of epithelium due to
chronic irritation or abrasion.

Hypersecretion of cortisol
leads to
increased fat deposition in certain
areas, such as face and back,
elevated blood pressure, and
alters blood cell distribution.
Clinically cortisol hypersecretion
is referred to as Cushing’s
syndrome, a condition usually
corrected through surgical
removal of part of adrenal gland.

Hypersensitivity
is a condition in
which there is an exaggerated or
inappropriate immune reaction
that causes tissue destruction or
inflammation.

Hypersensitivity of drug
is an
unwanted drug reaction related
to abnormal individual susceptibility.
It is related to genetic
factors. Drugs can act as antigens
causing immunologically
induced inflammatory response.
Topical administration may cause
a greater number of reactions
than oral and parental. However,
parental administration will
result in wide spread reaction and
patients with multiple allergies
will have more reaction to drugs.

Hypersensitivity of teeth
is caused
by the initiating factors of a
hypersensitive pulp and is
usually cold food or drink or cold
air or stimulation of exposed
dentin on the root surface by cold,
sweet or sour substances. Fruits
and salts may also result in
hypersensitivity. The sensation
disappears as soon as electrolyte
is diluted away or metal is
removed. Actually pain can be
evoked from dentin by applying
solutions to it which exert high
osmotic pressure. A sharp,
sudden painful reaction is seen
when a tooth is exposed to hot,
cold, chemical, mechanical or
osmotic (sweet or salt) stimuli.

Hypersensitivity Type II
reaction
is caused by IgG and IgM
antibodies and is capable of
causing type III hypersensitivity
reaction as well. The main
distinction is that type II reactions
involve antibodies directed to Ag
on the surface of specific cells or
tissues whereas type III are due
to antibodies against widely
distributed antigen or soluble Ag
in serum. While damage caused
by Type II localizes reaction to a
particular tissue or cell type,
damage caused by type III react
affects those organs where Ag-
Ab complexes are deposited.
These hypersensitive reactions
are related to normal immune
responses seen against microorganism
and parasites. In the
reaction against pathogens,
exaggerated immune reaction
may be as damaging to the host
as the effects of the pathogen
itself. These reactions are seen in
autoimmune disease, transplantation
reactions.

Hypersensitivity Type IV
is a
delayed type of reaction. In the
original classification by Coomb
and Gell in 1968, Delayed
hypersensitivity or type IV was
used as a general category to
describe all those hypersensitivity
reactions, which took place more
than 12 hrs to develop. DTH
cannot be transferred from one to
another by serum. It is associated
with T- cell protective immunity.

Hypertensive arteriosclerosis
shows thickening of arteries in
case of hypertension. Medium
and large sized arteries show
hypertrophy of media due to
increased number of smooth
muscle cell and elastic fibres. In
later stage hyalinisation of vessel
wall may occur.

Hypertensive brain hemorrhage
are putamen and around internal
capsule, thalamus, pons and
cerebellum. It generally does not
occur in white matter. Putaminal
hemorrhage is characterized by
contralateral hemiplegia. In
bigger hematoma there may be
development of bilateral motor
palsy, irregular respiration and
dilated fixed pupil. Thalamic
hemorrhage develops hemi
sensory defect, unequal pupils.
Pontine hemorrhage produces
deep coma, pinpoint reactive
pupil, quadriplegia and hyperthermia.
Cerebellar hemorrhage
presents with ataxia, headache
and hydrocephalus.

Hyperthyroidism
is known as
thyrotoxicosis, due to overproduction
of thyroxine. It may be
caused by Graves’ disease.
Hyperthyroidism Symptoms are
due to increased metabolic
activity of tissues or body. BMR
is increased. Thyroid is enlarged,
Enlargement may be asymmetrical
and nodular, Thyroid
may be tender, Liver and spleen
may be enlarged, Nervousness,
muscle weakness and fine
tremors, cardiac palpitation,
irregular heart beat and excessive
perspiration develops. Tachycardia,
and increased pulse pressure,
Ankle edema and systolic
hypertension, Amenorrhea,
infertility, decreased libido and
impotence are noted. There may
be lymphadenopathy and
osteoporosis. There may be
alveolar resorption, Trabaculae
may be of greater density, faster
eruption and premature loss of
primary teeth, early eruption of
permanent teeth, early jaw
development, generalized decrease
in bone density is seen with
loss of edentulous alveolar bone.

Hypertonic
is a solution containing
a higher level of salt i.e. NaCl than
is found in living RBC which is
0.9% NaCl.

Hypertrophic Lichen planus
may
occur on oral mucosa as a well
circumscribed elevated white
lesion like leukoplakia. Biopsy is
required to confirm diagnosis.

Hypertrophy
is overgrowth of
tissue.

Hyperventilation
is a condition
caused by rapid respirations
leading to acapnia i.e. carbon
dioxide depletion and subsequent
respiratory alkalosis. Person
develops light headedness,
trembling, tingling and numbness.
It may be caused by
excessive nervousness or hysteria.

Hypervitaminosis D
refers to
excess of vitamin D in body.
Toxicity has been found to result
when daily doses of between
10,000 and 50,000 i.u. are taken
over a prolonged period of time.
This vitamin is resistant to heat
and cooling process. Being fat
soluble it is stored in body.
Excessive intake of vitamin D
results in anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, excessive thirst and
drowsiness. Cramps and tingling
of finger and toes are also noted.

Hypervitaminosis
is an excess of
specific vitamins accumulated in
the body to the level of toxicity.
Commonest is vitamin A and
vitamin D.

Hypnotics
are drugs which are
used to induce sleep and drowsiness.
They depress the central
nervous system acting on central
cerebral cortex.

Hypocalcaemia
refers to where
serum calcium falls below 8 mg %.
It may be due to decreased bone
resorption of calcium, decreased
intestinal calcium resorption
calcium binding and sequestration.
Clinical features include
numbness, cramps, anxiety and
tetany followed by convulsions,
laryngeal stridor, dystonia and
psychosis. 10 ml of 10% calcium
gluconate IV followed by 10-40 ml
of 10% calcium gluconate in 5%
dextrose gives relief. Oral vitamin
D and calcium are needed.

Hypocalcification
is the lack or
deficiency of initial calcification of
organic enamel matrices.

Hypocalcified type of amelogenesis imperfecta
is characterized
by enamel of normal thickness
which is poorly calcified. These
are of two types; one is inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait
and other as autosomal recessive
trait. At eruption teeth presents as
yellow to orange enamel which is
soft and rapidly lost. It leaves
exposed dentin. Radiographically
enamel has moth eaten
appearance and is less radiopaque
than dentin. Cervical
enamel is better calcified.

Hypoglossal nerve
is a twelfth
cranial motor nerve. It supplies
muscles of tongue controlling its
shape and movement (see Figure
on page 237).

Hypoglycaemic encephalopathy
refers to when blood sugar level
falls below 25-30 mg causes
confusion, convulsion, hemi
paresis and coma. Overdose of
insulin may result in the
condition. Initial symptoms are
headache, palpitation, anxiety,
trembling and profuse sweating.
When blood sugar falls below 10
mg/dL patient develops deep
coma, dilated pupils, hypotonia
and shallow respiration. Prompt
correction of hypoglycaemia
before the onset of medullary
phase reverses the symptoms.

Hypoglycemia
is when blood sugar
falls below 40 mg %. It occurs
when liver glucose output falls
below the glucose uptake by
peripheral tissues and when
brains requirement is not met,
patient shows neurological
symptoms like psychiatric
disorder, fits, epilepsy and
cerebrovascular disease. Patient
may feel tired and weak;
palpitation, sweating and hunger
may develop. Later headache,
confusion, visual disturbance,
ataxia and personality changes
appear. Lastly convulsions and
coma may develop. Blood sugar
may be very low in polycythemia
and leukaemia.

Hypokalaemia
refers to low level
of potassium in the body. Patient
becomes listless with slow and
slurred speech with intense
drowsiness. Tone of muscles is
reduced. The reflexes become
absent. Patient may develop
incontinence of urine. Abdomen
is distended and bowel sounds
become absent. Pulse may
become irregular.

Hypomagnesemia
refers to low
level of magnesia. In this
condition patient may complaints
of anorexia, weakness and
apathy. One may feel tremor,
ataxia and vertigo along with
depression/irritability and
psychotic behavior. Hence twice
the estimated deficit is to be given.

Hypomaturation
can be explained
as lack of secondary mineralization
or maturation.

Hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta
refer to a
developmental disturbance of
teeth where enamel is normal in
form but is opaque and white to
brownish yellow. Teeth are
mottled. Teeth are soft and
develop attrition.

Hypoparathyroidism
refers to
when there is insufficient secretion
of parathyroid hormone. It may
result from autoimmune
destruction, surgical damage to
parathyroid, parathyroid damage
from radioactive iodine I-131.
Clinical features include stiffness
in hands, feet and lips, parasthesia
around mouth, tingling in fingers
and toes, anxiety and depression
and intelligence is lowered. Oral
Manifestations are delayed
eruption of teeth and hypoplasia
of enamel.

Hypopituitarism
may be congenital
or due to destructive disease.
Space occupying lesions like
craniopharyngioma, adenomas
may result it. There is symmetrical
underdevelopment but in
some cases there may be disproportionate
length of long bones.
Hypoglycemia may develop due
to growth hormone and cortisol
deficiency. Onset of puberty is
delayed. Patient becomes
lethargic, fat mass is increased.
Skull and facial bones are small.
Tooth eruption is hampered,
dental arch is smaller than
normal, so overcrowding of teeth
results, Eruption of teeth is
delayed, and so is the shedding
of deciduous teeth.

Hypoplasia due to congenital syphilis
is contracted in utero
from a mother who had
treponemal infection. Syphilis
produces classic patterns of
hypoplastic dysmorphic
permanent teeth. Saber shins,
frontal bossing and saddle nose
are common structural anomalies.
Congenital syphilis clinically will
present with (1) Interstitial
Keratosis (2) Deafness (3) Tooth
anomalies (Hutchinson’s triad).
The hypoplasia involves the
maxillary and mandibular
permanent incisors and the first
molars. The anterior teeth
affected are called “Hutchinson’s
teeth” while the molars are
referred to as “Mulberry Molar”
(Moon’s molars, Fournier’s
molars). The upper central incisor
is “screw – driver” shaped, the
mesial and distal surfaces of the
crown tapering and converging
towards the incisal edge of the
tooth rather than towards the
cervical margin. As a result,
diastema is occasionally observed
between the central incisors. The
cause of the tapering and
notching of the maxillary incisor
has been explained on the basis
of the absence of the central
tubercle or calcification center.
The crowns of the first molar in
congenital syphilis are irregular
and the enamel of the occlusal
third of the tooth appears to be
arranged in an agglomerate mass
of globules rather than in wellformed
cusps.

Hypoplasia of parotid gland
is
seen with Melkerson – Rosenthal
syndrome. It consists of orofacial
granuloma, facial paralysis and
fissured tongue.

Hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta
main defect is in formation
of matrix. Enamel is irregular
pitted but hard and translucent.
Defects become stained but caries
don’t develop easily.

Hyposensitization
is the therapy
involving the injection of
increasing doses of allergen.
Following treatment there is an
increase in serum levels of
allergen specific IgG and
suppressor T cell activity while
specific IgE levels tend to fall.
However, since allergic humans
are clinically diagnosed after
sensitization and this may explain
the relative lack of success of
desensitization in many subjects.

Hypothesis
is a proposed explanation
of an observed phenomenon
or it is a conjectural statement of
the relationship between variables.

Hypothyroidism
is a condition
where secretion of thyroid is
diminished. It may be due to
atrophy of thyroid gland or
failure of thyrotropic function of
pituitary gland. It may lead to
three types: Cretinism- hormone
failure occurs in infancy, Juvenile
myxedema- it occurs in childhood,
Myxedema- it occurs after
puberty. Clinical features:
cretinism and myxedema may be
present at birth, constipation and
hoarse cry may result, delayed
fusion of epiphysis, hair becomes
dry and sparse cretinism leads to
mental defects, generalized
edema and other changes. Base of
skull is shortened. Face fails to
develop in longitudinal direction.
Mandible is underdeveloped.
Tongue is enlarged by edema
fluid. Development of teeth is
delayed.

Hypoxia
is low oxygen level.

Hysteric tremor
tends to involve a
limb or the whole body and is
worsened by the examiner’s
attempt to control it.

Ice immersion
is a
procedure in which the
part to be treated is
immersed in an ice
solution such as hand,
feet and elbows.
Solution is made up of
50% water and 50% ice.
It has to be single less
than 10 minutes immersion or
shorter immersion making a
cumulative time of 10 minutes.

Ice packs
Crushed or flanked ice
placed inside a specially made
terry towel bag. It may be done
by folding towel into an
appropriate shape. The wet ice
pack is placed on the top of the
part to be treated. It should not
put pressure to obstruct the
circulation. Reduced circulation
may lead to ice burn.

Id
was described by Sigmond
Frued in 1905 in psychosexual
theory. In Latin it means ‘it’
Greek- primal urges, it is the basic
structure of personality which
serves as reservoir of instincts (or)
their mental representative.
Present at birth, impulse ridden
and drives immediate pressure
gratification.

like atypical
facial pain and idiopathic
xerostomia is considered a
manifestation of depression.
Taste dysfunction is reported as
a complaint by burning mouth
syndrome.

of remissions and exacerbations
when platelet count is low,
excessive bleeding may occur
after dental extraction. Bleeding
time is prolonged.

Idoxuridine
is used as anti
herpetic agent in treatment of
mouth and eye infections due to
herpe’s simplex ions.

IL-1 (Interleukin-1)
is a proinflammatory,
multifunctional
cytokine, which among its many
biological activities enables
ingress of inflammatory cells into
sites of infection, promotes bone
resorption, stimulates eicosanoid
(specifically PGE2) release by
monocytes and fibroblasts,
stimulates release of Matrix
metalloproteinases, that degrade
proteins of the extracellular
matrix, and participates in many
aspects of the immune response.

IL-6-1 (Interleukin-6)
is a cytokine
that stimulates plasma cell
proliferation and therefore
antibody production and is
produced by lymphocytes,
monocytes and fibroblasts.
Levels of IL-6 have been shown
to be elevated in inflamed
tissues, higher in periodontitis
than in gingivitis tissues and
higher in Gingival crevicular
fluid (GCF) from refractory
periodontitis. IL-6 has been
shown to stimulate osteoclast
formation. Thus, this cytokine
may in large part account for
both the predominance of
plasma cells in periodontitis
lesions as well as bone
resorption.

IL-8 (Interleukin-8)
is a chemo
attractant that is mainly
produced by monocytes in
response to lipopolysaccharide,
IL-1 or Tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α). It is present at
high levels in periodontitis
lesions, mainly associated with
the junctional epithelium and
macrophages. In addition to
serving as a chemo-attractant for
neutrophils, it appears to
selectively stimulate matrix
metalloproteinase activity from
these cells, thus in part accounting
for collagen destruction
within periodontitis lesions.

Illegitimate child
is the one which
is born out of wedlock or not
within a competent line after the
cessation of relationship of
husband and wife or when
procreation by the husband is
not possible due to congenital

days. It can be given once daily.
It results in papillary dilatation,
paralysis of accommodation,
dryness of mouth, postural
hypotension and urinary
retention.

Immunity
is a resistance exhibited
by the host towards injury
caused by micro-organisms and

is any substance
capable of inducing an immune
response called an immunogen
and is said to be immunogenic.

Immunology
is the study of the
ways in which the body defends
itself from infectious agents and
other foreign substances in its
environment. It encompasses
many layers of defense including
physical barriers like skin,
protective chemical substances
in the blood and tissue fluids and
the physiologic reaction of
tissues to injury or infection.

where teeth cannot erupt due to
physical obstruction.

Impaction-bony
refers to the tooth
that is blocked by both bone and
tissue.

Implant
is a titanium post that is
implanted into bone. A crown,
bridge, or denture is then placed
over the implant to restore function
and esthetics. Overdentures
and bridges rely on presence of
teeth for retention. If there are no
tooth roots for an overdenture
artificial tooth roots are to be
implanted into alveolar bone.
Implants are made up of titanium
and consist of threaded
cylinders which are screwed in
bones.

Implantation
is the procedure
where the placement with in
body tissue of a foreign
substance.

Implied contract
is established
between patient and doctor. An
expressed contract is informed
consent given in writing or
verbally. Gardian’s consent is
given when patient is minor or
is not mentally competent to do
so. Written consent is an expressed
consent.

Impotence
is the inability to have
sexual intercourse. While
sterility is the inability of male
have the child. A person can be
sterile without being impotence.

Impression
is the negative replica
of an oral cavity.

Impression material
is used to
make an accurate replica of oral
tissues area involved varies from
a single tooth to the whole
dentition. Impression gives a
negative reproduction of tissue
and by filling it, positive case is
made. Die is used to prepare
inlays or bridge.

Impression compound
is a solid
material which is softened by
heat to a plastic consistency
suitable for recording
impression. Upon cooling it
hardens rapidly in oral cavity.
Slab form is softened in hot water
and sticks which are softened
over a flame. It gives a full
denture by means of a perfect
peripheral seal. Disadvantage is
that it cannot be withdrawn from
undercut areas without
distortion.

Impression paste
is a material
used to make impression of
dentures. It is supplied in
2 tubes. One containing white
zinc oxide mixture and the other
containing red eugenol mixture.
Equal length of mixtures are
mixed together with a spatula to
give an uniform pink mix.
Disadvantage of it is not very
useful for partial impressions.

Impression tray
is a tray that is
made up of either stainless steel
or plastic formed in the general
shape of the mouth, used for
taking impressions. These are of
two types. Partial trays are used
for impressions of partial
dentures and edentulous trays
are used for full dentures. These
are semicircular in cross section.

refers to the
immunity to disease that is
inherited.

Incidence
is defined as the number
of new cases occurring in defined
population during a specified
period of time.

Incipient interproximal lesion
extends less than halfway
through the thickness of enamel.
The term incipient means
beginning to exist. An incipient
lesion is seen in enamel only.

Incipient malocclusion
may be
defined as a condition, which
shows a tendency to develop into
a deviation from the normal
dentofacial or occlusal relationship.

Incisal edge
is the cutting edge,
ridge, or surface of anterior teeth.

Incisive foramen
is an opening or
hole in bone located at midline
of the anterior portion of hard
palate, posterior to maxillary
central incisor. It appears radiolucent.

is the nerve that
originates at the mental foramen
and innervates those teeth anterior
alveolar nerve.

Incisor liability
is the size
difference between the four
permanent maxillary incisors
teeth and four primary incisor
teeth. According to Baume it is
7.6 mm in maxilla and 6.0 mm in
mandible.

Incisors
refer to the central and
lateral incisors; the first and
second teeth from the midline of
the mouth. In permanent and
primary dentition, they are 8 in
number four upper, i.e. 2 central
2 lateral and four lower, i.e.
2 central, 2 laterals.

Inclination angle
gives an
assessment of the indication of
the maxillary base. It is the angle
formed by the Pn line and palatal
bone. A large angle expresses
upward and forward inclination,
whereas small angles indicates
down and back tipping of the
anterior end of the palatal plane
and maxillary base. This angle
does not correlate with growth
pattern.

Inclination of the nasal base
is
angle formed between true
vertical (e.g. SnV) and the long
axis of the nostril varies from
about 90° in men to as much as
105° in women.

is an
expression of clinical observation
in numerical values which is
used to describe the status of the
individual or group with respect
to a condition being measured
Index (Russel A.L) has been
defined as a numerical value
describing the relative status of
a population on a graduated
scale with definite upper and
lower limits, which is designed
to permit and facilitate
comparison with other
populations classified by the
same criteria and methods.

occurs through dirty hands,
soiled laundry, contaminated
instruments touching during
dental procedure.

power of action, motion or
resistance.

Infancy (Soother or Nursing Bottle) Caries
is a rapidly
progressing type of dental caries
that affects the primary teeth of
children, usually during the first
2 years of life and as early as the
first year. In infant there is a
unique distribution of dental
decay. The 4 maxillary anterior
incisors are affected first; these
teeth are anatomically so
positioned in the mouth as to be
most frequently bathed by a
feeding and if unchecked the
decay may extend to the
maxillary and mandibular
molars. Initially, the lower
anterior teeth may not be
involved because of the
protective environment of the
mandibular salivary secretions
and the cleansing action of the
tongue muscles. Infancy caries is
most often seen in children with
an unusual dietary history such
as the addition of syrup, honey
or sucrose to the formula of the
use. It has been reported that
prolonged and unrestricted
night time breastfeeding can
result in increased caries rates.

Infancy
refers to the 1st year after
birth and the first 4 weeks of
which are designated as the new
born or neonatal period.

Infantile beri beri
is a condition
that results in infants between
second and sixth month
deficiency of to day of vit B6
(Thiamine). Illness develops
acutely and is rapidly fatal. Child
becomes restless, often cries,
passes less of urine and becomes
puffy. He may develop convulsions
and coma. Child may
become cyanosed suddenly with
tachycardia and dies within
24-48 hours.

Infantile swallowing
is a non
congenital conditional reflex.
During the normal infantile
swallowing the tongue lies in
between the gumpads and the
mandible is stabilized by an
obvious contraction of the facial
muscle. The buccinator muscle is
strong in infantile swallow as it
is during nursing. The normal
infantile swallow is such in the
neonate and gradually disappears
with the eruption of molars
in the primary dentition.

Infectious mononucleosis
also
called kissing disease include,
fever, sore throat, malaise and
glandular enlargement. Fauces
may show exudates. Spleen is
enlarged. Hepatitis may be seen.
Liver may be enlarged. In severe
cases myocarditis, neuritis and
encephalitis may develop.

Infective conjunctivitis
presents
with red eye with discomfort and
a foreign body sensation in the
eye. There is sticking together of
lid margins during sleep.
Chemosis of conjunctiva is
present. Mucopurulent discharge
is seen at the inner
canthus, lower fornix or at the
root of eye lashes.

Infective oral ulcer
occurs mostly
due to tuberculosis usually
dorsum of tongue. Shape is
angular or stellate. Floor is pale
in color with thick mucus like
material in base of ulcer. Edge is
irregular with undermined
border. No extra specific treatment
is required.

Inferior alveolar nerve
is nerve
that descends medial to the
lateral pterygoid muscle then
passes downward to the medial
surface of the ramus and
pterygomandibular space where
it enters in mandibular foramen
(see Figure).

Inferior alveolar neuritis
involves
the mandibular dental nerve
within the mandibular canal. It
may result due to trauma,
surgery or dental sepsis. Pain
may be felt in all structures
innervated by these nerve fibres.
No autonomic or muscle
symptoms are present.

Inferior Vena Cava
is one of the
two large veins carrying blood
into right atrium (see Figure on
page 248).

Inflammation
is the reaction of the
body to the irritation. It is a
defence reaction and not actually
a disease. White cells are body’s
main defence mechanism hence
there is always a increase of
blood flow to the infected part.
WBCs fight against invading
bacteria. Cardinal signs of
inflammation are swelling,
redness, heat, pain and loss of
function. Pain is caused by
increased pressure of blood on
nerves. Affected part is unable to
function properly.

Inflammatory gingival enlargement
is caused by prolonged
exposure to dental plaque. It
originates as a slight ballooning
of the interdental papilla and /
or marginal gingiva. In early
stages, a line preserving shape
bulge is seen around the teeth. It
progresses slowly uniting the
part of the crowns. It is usually
painless, unless complicated by
acute infection or trauma.
Occasionally, discrete, sessile or
pedunculated mass may be
present, which may be inter
proximal or on the marginal or
attached gingival. Painful
ulceration may occur by the folds
of the mass and adjacent gingiva.
The gingiva may be deep red or
bluish red in color, soft and
friable in consistency, soft and
shiny surface bleeds easily.
Histologically, connective tissue
shows preponderance of
inflammatory cells. There is
vascular engorgement with new
capillary formation. The gingiva
may be relatively firm, resilient
and pink. When superimposed
with infection, involved tissue
appears glossy, smooth, edematous
and bleed readily. Fetid
odour may occur. Drifting of
teeth occurs in long standing cases.
In mouth breathers; maxillary
anterior gingiva is affected. Local
treatment is of value.

Inflammatory pocket wall
is said
to be occurred where there is
presence of inflammatory fluid.
Pocket wall appear red, soft,
spongy, friable with the smooth
and shiny surface.

Inflammatory spine pain
is worst
in the morning and improves
with activity. Any activitiy
makes it worst. Pain may come
down to knees, hips and shoulder.
Such lesions include sacroiliac
joint inflammation/fusion,
peripheral joint arthritis etc.

Influenza
starts suddenly with all
signs of fever, cough and
running nose like common cold.
Fever is often associated with
chills or rigor like malaria. Body
ache is too much. Several strains
of influenza have been
discovered. There is no specific
test to diagnose it.

Infra red relief of pain
It is an
effective means of relieving pain.
Relief of pain is due to sedative
effect on the superficial sensory
nerve endings. It has been
suggested that pain may be due
to deposite of waste products of
metabolism and an increase of
blood flow removes these
products. Pain due to actue
inflammation is relieved by mild
heating. One should note that
intense heat may cause an
increase in exudation of fluid
into tissues increasing the pain.

Infrabony pocket/Infracrestal pocket/Infralveolar pocket
is
the term used where the base of
the pocket is apical to the level
of adjacent alveolar bone.

Infrared soldering
is also
procedure when dental
appliance is be soldered using an
infrared light source. Here
focused light beam is used. The
light supplies the sufficient heat
to bring the parts to the soldering
temperature and melt the solder.

Ingot
refers to cast rod of alloy.

Inhalation anesthetic agents
are
those drugs which are
adminestered in the body by
means of inhalation. Nitrous
oxide is the gas which is
constantly used with at least 20%
oxygen. It requires a specific
equipment to mix the gas in the
specific proportion. Any drug or
equipment necessary for
resuscitation should be easily
available in emergency.

Inhalation transmission
is due to
inhalation of micro-organism
aerolised from a patient’s blood
or saliva when doctor is using
high speed of ultrasonic
equipment.

Inherited taste disorder
dysautonomia
is rare found in jews.
Affected children are usually
hypotonic, easily being disturbed.
There is an excessive sweat
and mucus production. Such
children don’t have vallate and
fungiform papillae. Tongue is
devoid of taste receptors.

Injury
to oral tissues results in
tissue damage. Physical injury
can affect teeth, soft tissue and
bone. Chemical injury occurs
due use of caustic materials.
Micro-organisms can cause
injury by invading oral tissue.

Inlay
is a gold, porcelain, or
composite custom-made filling
cemented into the tooth. If it
covers the tips of the teeth, it is
called an onlay.

Innate/Immunity
refers to any
inborn resistance that is present.
First time the pathogen is
encountered. It does not require
previous exposure and is not
modified significantly by
repeated exposures to the
pathogen over the life of an
individual.

Inoculation
is introduction of
micro-organism into living
tissues culture media.

Inositol
in 1940 Dr Wooley in
America discovered that mice
fed on diet deficient in inositol
suffered from stunted growth
and falling hair. Its high
concentrations are found in
muscles of heart and brain. Lack
of it results in baldness. If taken
with vitamin E it stimulates hair
growth. Daily requirement is
10 mg.

Insertion
is the point where
muscle attaches to bone.

Insidious
refers to coming on
gradually.

Integrin mediated phase
develops
slowly but leads to stable long
lasting molecular contacts that
prevent further movement of
neutrophils and cause it to flatten
out against the endothelium.
Once attached, neutrophils
actively move themselves
between endothelial cells to
migrate out of the venule.
Emigration and chemotaxis are
facilitated in part by binding of
neutrophil surface integrins to
fibronectin and other components
of extracellular matrix.

Integrins
are a group of
heterodimer proteins with alpha
and beta polypeptides chains.
Integrins bind a variety of ECM
cells as well as non-integrin
adhesion molecules such as
vascular cell adhesion molecule
found on stoma cell surface.
They allow progenitors to bind
tightly to marrow stoma and are
responsible for sequestering
progenitor cells in appropriate
microenvironment. Contact of
integrin with its ligand also
transmits a signal into the
integrin expressing cell, which
can stimulate its growth and
other activities.

Intelligence quotient
refers to the
relationship between intelligence
and chronological age.

Intention tremor
is the manifestation
of cerebellar disease, the
superior cerebellar peduncle.

Inter costal muscles
are respiratory
muscles found in between
ribs.

Inter radicular
means between the
roots.

Inter transitional period
is the
period which maxillary and
mandibular arches consists of
sets of deciduous and permanent
teeth. Between the permanent
incisors and first permanent
molars are the deciduous molars
and canines. This phase during
the mixed dentition period is
relatively stable and no change
occurs.

Interceptive orthodontics
is phase
of science and art of orthodontics
employed to recognize and
eliminate potential irregularities
and malpositions in the
developing dentofacial complex.
These procedures are employed
to lessen or to eliminate the
severity of developing malocclusion
either due to heredity or
extremes or intrinsic factors.

Intercuspal position (ICP)
refers
to that position of mandible
when there is maximal intercuspation
between the maxillary
and the mandibular teeth.

Intercuspation
is the interlocking;
a cusp-to-fossa relationship of the
maxillary to mandibular teeth.

Interdental eyelet wiring
is a
wiring technique where eyelets
are constructed with a help of
artery forceps, these eyelets are
fitted between two teeths and
push the wire on the lingual/
palatal aspect as eyelets tend to
get displaced. The free ends are
then passed from the adjacent
proximal contact, the distally
placed free end wire is passed
through the eyelet and then it is
twisted along with the mesially
placed free wire. To connect the
upper and lower jaw, the wire is
passed through the upper and
lower eyelets and then plaited
together at the lower border of
the mandibular teeth.

Interdental gingiva
occupies the
gingival embrasure, which is the
interproximal space beneath the
area of tooth contact. The
interdental gingival can be
pyramidal or have a “col” shape
in the adult dentition, which is
more susceptible to infection. In
the primary dentition, interdental
spacing is common.
Hence saddle areas are present
resulting in a well-keratinized
interdental surface. This may be
the reason for lower prevalence
of periodontal lesions in children
because these areas are less
vulnerable to development and
progression of the inflammatory
spaces.

Interdental knives
are knives used
in the interdental area. These are
spear shaped knives that has
cutting edge on both the sides of
the blade that are available in
double ended or single ended
blades e.g. Orban knife no 1-2
and Merrifield knife no 1-4.

Interference/Supracontact
refers
to any contact in ICP or other
movements, that prevents the
remaining occlusal surfaces to
achieve stable occlusion.

Interlabial gap
is the vertical
distance between the upper and
lower lip ranges between 0 and
3 mm.

Intermaxillary fixation (IMF)
is a
method where the immobilization
is achieved by the help of
intermaxillary wiring, a clinical
union of bone can be expected
with in four weeks and without
using general anesthesia.

Intermittent fever
refers to a fever
that is present only for several
hours during the day.

Internal bevel incision
is the
incision used in periodontal
surgeries. It is the incision from
which flap is reflected to expose
the underlying bone and root. It
starts from the designated area on
the gingiva and is directed to the
area at or near the crest of the bone.

Internal resorption
is an insidious
process when the afflicted pulp
is completely symptom free.
Symptoms of internal resorption
depend primarily on whether
the process had broken through
the external tooth surface. The
pulp that erodes through the root
surface may give vague pain on
mastication. Percussion may be
of little value. Pulpectomy is the
only treatment for internal
resorption. No early symptoms
are present. Generally only one
tooth is affected. On radiograph
involved tooth shows a round or
oval radiolucent area in central
portion of tooth. If tooth is not
treated, complete perforation
may take place.

Interneuron
are nerves that
conduct impulses from sensory
neurons to motor neurons.

Interoceptors
are the pain receptors
which are located within the
body cavities, there serve involuntary
bodily function below
conscious levels, e.g. Free nerve
endings: perception of visceral
pain and other sensation. Pacinian
corpuscles gives perception
of pressure.

Interpret
is to offer an explanation.

Interproximal
is the space present
between two adjacent surfaces.

Interradicular fibers
occurs in a
multirooted tooth as they fan out
from the cementum of the tooth
in to the furcation area.

Interstitial brain edema
occurs
during acute hydrocephalus due
to sudden or persistently high
intraventricular CSF pressure,
the ependyma gets damaged and
CSF escapes to the periventricular
white matter interstitial
space known as interstitial
edema. Fluid spreads along
angles of lateral ventricle.

Intervertebral disk rupture
produces gradual or sudden low
backache with or without
sciatica. Pain radiates to legs.
Pain is increased by coughing,
spasm. Reflexes are decreased on
affected side. Patient leans
towards the affected side.

Intestinal tuberculosis
is a disease
involving caecum, mesenteric
glands and peritoneum are
generally involved. Miliary TB is
the primary lesion. Common
presenting symptoms are
abdominal pain, malabsorption,
diarrhea, low grade fever and
loss of appetite. Ulcers are
circular and may cause
obstruction. Mantoux test may
be positive. Ascites is exudative
in nature with raised protein and
plenty of leucocytes. Treatment
is with INH, rifampicin,
pyrazinamide and streptomycin
for 3 months and INH and
rifampicm for another 9 months.

Intracerebral hemorrhage
is also
called apoplexy. Most commonly
seen in individuals over
50 years of age. Intracerebral
hemorrhage may develop in any
blood vessel, but usual source of
bleeding is from arteries. Two
major sources of intracerebral
hemorrhage are ruptured arterial
aneurysms and hypertensive
vascular disease. Rupture occurs
with sudden increase in local
pressure. Clinically most cases of
intracerebral hemorrhage occurs
while patients are engaged in
normal activities like heavy lifting,
factors categorized as physical
stress and that are associated
with elevation of blood pressure.
Both anxiety and pain are associated
with significant increase in
heart rate and blood pressure of
patient making development of
a hemorrhagic CVA more likely.

Intra ligamentary anesthesia
refers to the administration of
anesthetic agent in to the
ligament. Some people find an
inferior dental block unpleasant
due to tongue and lip being
made numb. So injection is given
directly down the gingival
crevices. It immediately anesthetize
the tooth. Special
syringe/cartridge and needle are
required for administrating
anesthesia. Gingiva should be
healthy for such type of L-A.

Intractable pain
is when pain
unresponsive to usual methods
of pain management.

Intradermal nevus
is congenital
development of tumor like
malformation of the skin/mucus
membrane. Function of nevus
cells is to produce melanin.
These are commonly known as
mole of dark brown color. It is
slightly raised. Intraoral lesions
are commonly seen over hard
palate or gingival. These grow
slowly. Under microscope nevus
reveals cluster of nevus cells
confined within connective
tissue. No mitotic activity is seen.
These generally don’t require
any treatment.

Intramembranous ossification
is
a physiological process of bone
formation where bone is formed
directly in membranous tissue.

Intraocular pressure
means
pressure within eye.

Intraoral
is inside your mouth.

Intravenous anesthetics
is simpler
and leads to rapid pleasant
induction. Recovery is swift
without nausea and vomiting
and there is lack of pulmonary
irritation. I.V. anesthesia can be
used for induction of anesthesia
as a solid agent for very short
procedure. It should not be used
for maintenance of anesthesia.
Extra venous injection may
produce local necrosis. Overdose
and too rapid injections are its
cautions.

Intravenous sedation
is a method
where drug is introduced
through I.V. method. It can be
given to reduce anxiety in an
over anxious patient. This may
be insufficient for certain
restorative and minor surgical
procedure. Intravenous
diazepam is commonly used. It
is injected into a bigger vein to
avoid thrombophlebitis.
Dizepam produces muscle
relaxation and also a dry mouth.

confined to a fibrous capsule or
one well circumscribed. Capsule
is formed by atrophy of cells at
the periphery of expansile
growth. Malignant tumors don’t
respect normal anatomical
boundaries. In some malignant
tumors invasion is seen only
under microscope.

Investment material
is a special
gypsum product that is able to
withstand extreme heat.

Iodine deficiency
T3 and T4
production decrease because
iodine is necessary for the
synthesis of these thyroid
hormones. Low plasma levels of
T3 and T4 cause the secretion of
TSH. A persistent secretion of
TSH causes the thyroid gland to
enlarge, producing a goiter.

Iodine
forms thyroid hormone. Its
deficiency results in goiter. One
third iodine of whole body lies
in thyroid. An ovary also
contains more of iodine. Whole
blood contain 3 to 30 microgram.
It is constituent of thyroxin, an
active principle of thyroid gland.
It plays an important role in
energy metabolism and in
growth of body. Adult body
contains 50 mg of iodine.
Cabbage, cauliflower and radish
are goitrogenic not allowing food
iodine make available to body.

Iodine-tincture
is used as tincture
of iodine since 1839. Like
chlorine it is a powerful bactericide
and a fungicide. It is used
as sterilization of skin prior to
surgery. Weak iodine solution

potassium iodine in an alcoholic
solution. Local toxicity is very
slow. Some patient may show
hypersensitivity. Weak solution
is used as counter irritant in
traumatic periodontitis.

Iodophore
are complexes of iodine
and surface active agents such as
non-ionic detergents, quaternary
compounds and macromolecules.
The iodine is held in a
loose combination and about
70-80% may be available when
the solution is diluted.
Iodophores are non-toxic, nonirritating,
non-staining and
miscible with water in all
proportions. They do not
produce sensitivity and are
therefore used in prophylaxis.

inadequate absorption of iron
and excessive loss of iron. Oral
Manifestations include pallor of
oral mucosa and gingiva.
atrophic mucositis, loss of
tongue papillae, glossitis and
angular chelitis. Total RBC count
is low. Stool should be examined
for occult blood. Ferrous sulphate
in sufficient quantity helps.

Iron in pregnancy
Total of 300 mg
of iron is needed for the growth
of fetus, 70 mg for placenta and
500 mg for the synthesis of
hemoglobin with increased
blood volume. Iron accumulates
at the rate of 0.5 mg/daily in first
trimester. It may increase 3 to 4
mg/day in second and third
trimester. This extra iron need
cannot be met through diet so it
has to be supplied from outside.

Iron
is needed for formation of
blood and is absorbed in the
upper portion of duodenum.
When hemoglobin level is short,
absorption is high otherwise it is
low. Total iron in body is 3-4 gm
and daily requirement is 20 mg.
Idiopathic hemochromatosis
results in excessive iron
absorption. Deficiency of iron
result is anemia.

externally it is attached to the
gingival connective tissue by the
means of external basal lamina.

gemodermatosis transmitted as
autosomal dominant characteristic.
It is manifestated during
childhood. Skin lesions appear as
small, papules which are red.
When macerated, they produce
foul smelling masses. Oral lesions
develop as minute, whitish,
papules most commonly found
on gingiva and tongue. In less
severely affected cases intraoral

Lactobacilli
are gram positive, non
spore–forming rods that
generally grow best under micro

other oral organisms by its low
pH (5.4).

Lactose intolerance
is an intestinal
condition that causes symptoms
like cramping, abdominal
distension and gas problem.
There is an absence of body
L enzyme lactase which breaks
down lactose into glucose and
galactose. In this condition
lactose descends directly to the
large intestine where intestinal
bacteria break it down into acid
and gas causing discomfort.

Lag screws
are used for rigid
immobilization where the thread
of the screw engages only in the
inner plate of bone. The hole is
drilled in the outer cortex and is
slightly of a larger diameter than
the threaded part. Once
tightened, the head of the screw
engages in the outer plate and
the fracture is compressed.

connective tissue that lies just
under the epithelium of the
mucous membrane.

Laminate veneer
is porcelain, or
composite covering which is
bonded to restore discolored, or
damaged teeth.

inflammation of larynx result
due to abnormal use of vocal
cord. Excessive smoke may also
cause laryngitis. Rest to the voice
is helpful. Symptoms will clear
in few days. Carcinoma of larynx
produces hoarseness of voice.

high pitched inspirations and
dyspnea. It is caused by partial
or complete spasm or the vocal
cords. In complete spasm breath
sounds may be absent and
abdominal heaving becomes
prominent.

glottis and sub glottis.
Only the true vocal cords are
covered by non keratinised
Laminate preparation squamous epithelium.

Laser
Light Amplification by
Stimulated Emission of Radiation

Laser burns
are the burns caused
by lasers, basically thermal burns
where laser energy is used for
other purposes like hair removal,
resurfacing, vascular, pigmented
lesions and heat released is
dissipated into the normal skin
leading to skin burns. The
damage to the skin will depend
upon the energy released by the
laser, therefore these can be
superficial burns which are more
common or deep dermal when
the energy used is very high
which take a long time to heal.
Therefore wet gauze should be
kept in surrounding skin thus
isolating the treatment field as in
resurfacing and treating
pigmented or vascular lesions. In
case of hair removal cold air blast
is needed to be given along with
the laser beam to nullify the
effects of heat.

Laser welding
means where the
heat for welding is supplied by
focused beam of light generated
by a laser. Laser light can be
focused on small regions and can
apply high energy in a very short
period of time. There is very little
heating of total appliance except
at the point of application.

Late adolescence
is a period of
transition as the young person
(adult) consolidates his identity
and comes to grips with his
future.

Late shift
occurs where child lack
the primate spaces and thus the
erupting permanent molars are
unable to move forward to
establish class I relationship in
these cases when the deciduous
second molars exfoliate, the
permanent first molar drift
medially utilizing the leeway
space. This occurs in the late
mixed dentition period and is
thus called late shift.

Latent

of smooth muscle cells. Majority
of these cases are found on
posterior portion of tongue.
Palate and buccal mucosa may
also be involved. These grow
slowly and are painless
pedunculated mass. Mass does
not ulcerates and maintains the
normal color. Sub mucosal
nodules may be seen. These are
firm and yellow in color. Lesion
can be multi nodular. These are
composed of spindle shaped
smooth muscle cells. Surgical
excision including surrounding
normal tissue is practiced. After
surgery it does not recur nor
transform into malignancy (see
Figure on page 268).

Leiomyosarcoma
is a malignant
tumor of smooth muscle origin.
It is rare in oral cavity. The cheek
and floor of mouth are the
common sites. It looks like
leiomyoma except number of
mitosis. Patient may hardly
survive for 3-5 year.

Lepromatous leprosy
is
characterized by macules,
nodules and papules the features
of skin lesions. Lesions are
multiple and bilaterally
symmetrical. There is loss of
outer eyebrows, thickened and
corrugated skin of face and
forehead. Skin biopsy, ear lobe
clipping and nasal smear
examination helps.

Leprosy
is a chronic granulomatous
infection caused by an
acid fast bacillus. Mycobacterium
lepra causes
granulomatous infection of skin
and peripheral nerves.
Incubation period is 3 to 5 year.
Clinically it can be classified into
lepromatous leprosy and
tuberculoid leprosy. Onset is
insidious. To start a small area of
impaired sensation or numbness
is developed. There is lack of
sweating and lack of hair in
involved area surrounding
cutaneous nerve is thickened.
Oral lesions consist of tumor like
masses called lepromas
developing on lip, tongue and
hard palate. Gingiva may
enlarge and teeth may become
loose. Long term chemotherapy
is suggested.

Leukemia
is a malignant disease
with increased proliferation of
WBC’s at the cost of other cells.
It is more common in younger
age groups. Some may be of
immature form. Myeloid
leukemia involves granulocyte
series. Lymphoid leukemia
involves lymphocytic series and
monocytic leukemia involves
monocytic series. Each one of
them may be acute, subacute or
chronic. Exact cause is not
known. But exposure of high
doses of radiation therapy,
phenyl butazone, Chloramphenicol
may lead to it. Some
families have more incidence of
leukemia. These have been
classified into acute and chronic.
Generally either children or old
people are affected. Persistent
fever of unknown origin,
spontaneous bleeding from
gingiva, Multiple large ulcers
may develop on mucosa,
Candidiasis, histoplasmosis and
HSV infections are common in
leukemic patients, Teeth may
start loosening, alveolar destruction
may take place, Leukemic
cell infiltration may cause
atypical dental pain, There may
be prolonged bleeding after
extraction.

Leukoederma
is a white lesion of
oral cavity which clinically
resembles early leukoplakia. It
varies from film-like layer to
greyish white cast with a coarsely
wrinkled surface. It is more
prominent in bicuspid to occlusal
line. Etiology is not known.
Intraorally, the buccal mucosa
retains its normal softness and
flexibility. It exhibits a greyish
white folded opalescent
appearance. Leukoplakia is more
common to develop. Since it is a
variant of normal mucosa it does
not require any treatment.

Leukoplakia
is a premalignant
condition. It occurs as a white
patch over mucus membrane of
lip, hard and soft palate, floor of
mouth and gingiva. Patches of
leukoplakia may vary from non
palpable to thick white translucent
indurated lesion. These may
be fissured or papillomatous. It
may be localized or diffuse and
is of 3 types. Homogeneous leukoplakia
is a localized lesion. If
extensive it is of consistent pattern.
It may be wrinkled or
papillomatous. Verrucous
leukoplakia is an oral white lesion
in which surface is broken up by
multiple papillary projections.
Nodular granular is hairy mixed
white and red lesion. In it lesions
are scattered over an atrophic
patch of mucosa. Leukoplakia can
be developed on any part of oral
cavity but is more common on
buccal mucosa and gingiva. 50%
lesions affect cheeks. Tobacco,
alcohol, mechanical irritants are
causative factors. If floor of
mouth is involved then chances
of transforming into malignancy
are more. Microscopically one
finds cellular dysplasia. Benign
leukoplakia shows hyperkeratosis
and chronic inflammatory cell
infiltration. Cytological study is of
little importance. Topically applied
Toludine blue shows the
areas which are more likely to
show carcinomatous changes Biopsy
is to be done from that area.
Surgical excision done with or
without grafting remains the standard
treatment for leukoplakia.

Leukostasis syndrome

may be present. Bone marrow is
hypercellular with markedly
increased granulocyte precursor
specially metamyelocytes and
myelocytes.

muscle that arises from canine
fossa just below infra orbital
foramen and is inserted over
angle of mouth. Its action is to
raise angle of mouth and
produces nasolabial furrow.

Levator labii superioris
arises
from lateral surface of zygomatic
bone and passes down ward and
medially into muscular substance
of upper lip. It elevates the
upper lip and produces
nasolabial furrow.

point in the lower margin of the
lower membranous lip.

Lichen planus
is a common
dermatosis developing on mucus
membrane which appears as
small, angular, flat topped
papules only a few millimetres
in diameter. Papules are sharply
demarcated. Center of papule
may be slightly umbilicated. Its
surface is covered by greyish
white line known as wickhane’s
striae. Face generally remains
uninvolved. Early symptom is
pruritis causing severe itching.
Causative factor of lichen planus
is immunologically induced
degeneration of basal layer of
epithelium. There are three basic
types of erosions, keratosis,
erosions and bulla formation.
Psychogenic problems play an
etiological role. During deep
emotional problems remissions
and exacerbations are seen. It
may be associated with diabetes.
Generally it is a bullous form of
disease and a painless lesion, the
reticular form is slightly
elevated, fine, whitish line. Lines
are fine radiating of lacing in
nature cheeks and tongue are
generally affected. In the popular
form lesion is less than 1 mm in
size. It is whitish elevated lesion.
Bullous lichen planus is rare. It
presents coexisting bullous
pemphigoid. Atrophic lichen
planus is inflamed area covered
by red, thinned epithelium.
Erosive lesion is a complicated
atrophic process when thin
epithelium is ulcerated. Main
histological features of lichen
planus are Areas of hyperparakeratosis,
Liquefaction
degeneration, dense epithelial
band of lymphocyte damage of
basal cell layer is the diagnostic
point. The lesions of oral lichen
planus appears, regresses and
reappear in unpredictable
fashion. Lesions are too diffuse
to remove surgically and may
transform into malignancy.
Antihistamine rinses and
corticosteroids are useful. In
resistant cases intra lesional
injections of trimcinolne
acetonide are useful. Retinoids
may be given in addition.

Lichenoid drug reactions
are
white patches identical clinically
to lichen planus and are caused
by a mucosal reaction to certain
drugs. Drugs include phenothiazines,
dental amalgams and
dental composites, non steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs and
anti-hypertensive.

Life expectancy
is the average
number of years lived by an
individual or group born in the
same period.

Ligatures
are fine wires or elastic
bands used to tie or ligate the
arch wire to the brackets.

Light
is necessary for efficient
vision. Poor light causes fatigue
and loss of efficiency. An
illumination of 15-20 foot candles
is accepted as a basic minimum
for satisfactory vision. In dental
surgery 100% light should be
directed towards the area of
surgery i.e. interest.

Light activated denture base material
is used to fabricate
dentures with light activation.
Advantage of it is reduced
polymerization shrinkage,
possible better fit than conventional
base material and not
much of equipment is required.
But disadvantage is an increased
elastic deformation during
mastication.

Light cure system
are those system
that require light exposure for
the setting to occur. Light cure
materials such as durofill or
pekafill need exposure to bright
light for setting. A special lamp
is used and it makes a material
set in about a minute. No mixing
is required. Just a thin layer of
composite is needed to fill a
shallow cavity and one application
of curing light is needed.

Lightening injuries
have variable
affects. It may not always be fatal
but patient may fall unconscious
and stop breathing. However,
these patients withstand prolong
periods of apnoea and respond
very well to immediate CPR.
Burn markings are characteristic
for lightening injuries. There is a
spidery pattern of skin burns
which is caused by the currents
passage along pathway of skin
dampness where the resistance is
the lowest.

Lightning
is degradation of high
molecular weight complex
organic molecules that reflect
specific wave length of light
responsible for the color of the
stain into lower molecular
weight and less complex
molecules that reflect less light is
called lightning.

Lignocaine
is a local anesthetic
agent and was introduced in
1948. It diffuses rapidly and
onset is rapid. It produces
anesthesia within 2-3 minutes. It
is easily absorbed from mucus
membrane. It is an effective
surface anesthetic. It is more
potent than pilocaine. It is
available in spray form and also
a cream in concentration of 5%.
Saliva can washout its effects.

Limb placement reflex

have occurred when the front of
the leg below the knee, or the
arm below the elbow is brought
into contact with the edge of the
table, the child lifts the limbs
over the edge.

when all the
amino acids or sugar residues
that form an epitope are
positioned in linear sequence.
Not affected by heat, denaturation.

Lines of Cleavage and surgery
In certain regions of the body,
collagen fibers tend to orient
more in one direction than
another. Lines of cleavage
(tension lines) in the skin indicate
the predominant direction of
underlying collagen fibers. The
lines are especially evident on
the palmer surfaces of the
fingers, where they are arranged
parallel to the long axis of the
digits. An incision running
parallel to the collagen fibers will
heal with only a fine scar. An
incision made across the rows of
fibers disrupts the collagen, and
the wound tends to gap open and
heal in a broad, thick scar.

nodules, the remnants
follicle of thyroid tissues
are found in base of tongue. It is
a benign condition during puberty.

Lingual tonsils
are accumulations
of lymphoid tissue on the root of
the tongue. They may extend as
far back as epiglottis and
laterally through palatine tonsil.

of mouth, central surface of
tongue, soft palate, cheeks, lips
and alveolar mucosa. It is not
attached to bone.

Lip biting and lip sucking
is an
oral habit that sometimes
appears after forced discontinuation
of thumb or digit sucking.
Lip biting most often involves
the lower lip which is turned
inwards and pressure is exerted
on the lingual surfaces of the
maxillary anteriors. Clinically it
may appear as proclined upper
anteriors and retroclined,
hypertrophic and redundant
lower lip or a cracked lip.

Lipemia
is the presence of
abnormally high concentrations
of lipids in blood.

Lipoid proteinosis
is a condition
occurring due to disturbance in
mucopolysacchrides metabolism.

become thick. Painful parotitis
may occur repeatedly. No
specific treatment is available.

showing blood vessels. It is
composed of mature fat cell with
varying collagen strands. These
are yellowish in color with
smooth surface. There is no
surrounding capsule. Simple
surgical excision helps. Recurrence
is uncommon.

is an angiotensin
converting Enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor that is used to treat
hypertension.

Listerine
is an essential oil or
phenol mouthwashes used for
more than a century. Phenol as
an antiseptic made a breakthrough
in 1867 under John
Lister. Phenolic compounds
used alone, or combined with
mouth rinses and throat lozenges
have proved to be safe. The
action of phenols depends upon
the concentration and contact
time. Composition includes
menthol 0.04%, thymol 0.06%,
eucalyptol 0.09%, benzoic acid
0.015 %, ethyl alcohol 6-26%.
Listerine is contraindicated for
those patients on metronidazole/
tinidazole as it contains alcohol.

Liver abscess
is commonly caused
by E.Coli. It is slow growing with
fever. Pain may be a complaint.
Jaundice, tenderness in right
upper abdomen with leucocytosis

and metronidazole helps
but abscess larger than 5 cm may
require drainage.

Loading dose
is the larger dose of
a drug given initially to control
the disease effectively.

Lobar pneumonia
is a localized
infection of terminal air spaces.
The usual homogeneous lung
opacification is limited by fissure
and affected lobes retain normal
volume and show air bronchograms.
Streptococcus and
penumococii causes typical lobar
pneumonia. Consolidation may
not spread uniformly in lobe.

Lobe
refers to center of tooth
formation.

Local anesthetic infiltration
is a
method of administrating local
anesthesia that is given over apex
of tooth to be anesthetized.
Needle is inserted below the
mucous membrane. Infiltration
applies to nerve endings while
nerve block is done to trunk of
nerve. It is effective for all upper
teeth.

Local dental anesthesia
is a
procedure widely used in dental
practice to paralyz sensory nerve
endings by producing tissue
ischemia, application of cold or
putting pressure on nerve
trunks. Local anesthetics are
thought to act by stabilizing the
cell membrane. These prevent
inward movement of sodium
ions. Most local agents are
tertiary amines. Lignocaine and
procaine are good agents.

Local muscle soreness
is a local
condition with a local cause. It is
a lowered pain threshold due to
strain, injury, infection of
inflammation. Some pain is
thought to result from accumulation
of metabolites after
excessive use. Both ischemia and
hyperaemia are believed to relate
to paingenesis.

Localized diffuse gingivitis
is the
one which extends from the
margin to the mucobuccal fold
but is limited to a particular area.

Localized enamel hypoplasia
is a
type of hypoplasia occasionally
seen. Only a single tooth is
involved, most commonly one of
the permanent maxillary incisors
or a maxillary or mandibular
premolar. There may be any
degree of hypoplasia, ranging
from a mild, brownish discoloration
of the enamel to a severe,
pitting and irregularity of the
tooth crown.

Localized gingivitis
is said to
occur where the inflammation is
confined to a single tooth or a
particular area.

Localized marginal gingivitis
is
confined to one or more areas of
the marginal gingiva.

Localized papillary gingivitis
is
confined to one or more
interdental spaces in a particular
area.

Localized periodontitis
is said to
have occurred when less than
thirty percent of the areas
assessed in mouth demonstrate
the bone loss and loss of
attachment.

chronic, superficial pruritis
inflammation of the skin with
dry scaling. There will be
pigmented lichenified plaques
with oval and irregular shapes.
There is a strong psychogenic
component. Outer zone of patch
may have brownish discrete
papules and a central zone. The
involved skin will be red, moist
and hyper pigmented. Diagnosis
is mostly clinical. Topical
corticosteroids are most useful.
Zinc oxide paste can be locally
applied.

Location of dental plaque
Plaque
is a combination of bacteria,
bacterial products and saliva.
Supragingival plaque is formed
above gum line and consist of
different bacteria sublingual
plaque is formed below gum line.
Plaque is adhered to teeth by a
sticky polysaccharide produced
by bacteria specially streptococcus
mutans.

frenum insufficiency. Patient
mostly has been operated for
tongue tie. Tongue becomes
loose and difficult to control.
Dysarthria is present and signs
of airway obstruction take place
during sleep.

Loosely adherent subgingival plaque
is an unattached bacterial
plaque found adjacent to the
gingival epithelium or pocket
lumen.

Lorazepam
is a drug belonging to
a group of barbiturates and is 4
times more potent than
diazepam. Half life is 12 hours.
Onset of action is 30-60 minutes.
Psychomotor impairment is seen
for 12 hours. 2 mg orally of it is
equivalent of 10 mg oral
diazepam. 5 mg dose of it may
cause disorientation.

Loss of tooth
is referred to
extracted tooth and not replaced
artificially. In such condition
opposing tooth becomes useless
and it has nothing to bite. It loses
its beneficial effect of cleaning
and mastication. If several teeth
are missing mastication will be
affected to produce malnutrition.
Loss of one tooth can result in
plaque accumulation and in
caries in at least six other teeth.

Low blood pressure
refers to
inadequate intravascular
pressure to maintain oxygen
requirement of body’s tissues. It
may be drug induced. Normal
blood pressure varies typically a
reading below 90/60 mm Hg or
a drop of 30 mm Hg from base
line is considered low BP.
Dehydration and hemorrhage
may result it.

Low testosterone levels
presents
as disturbed sleep pattern, loss
of sensitivity of erogenous zones,
cold and shriveled penis. Person
starts gaining weight which is
difficult to loose it. Seminal
volume will be reduced with
reduced facial hari growth.

Low voltage electrical burns
are
the electrical burns that are
caused by low voltage (240 AC)
domestic appliances. Though
more common than the high
voltage burns they may be
deceptive in appearance as they
may penetrate deeply. They are
very commonly seen in infants
crawling on the floor or in
children who take the electrical
wires into their mouth and chew
them. They suffer severe damage
to the lips, tongue and mouth
and though the legion may be
small the reactive edema may
interfere with breathing and may
require tracheostomy.

Lower lip prominence
is the most
prominent point of the lower lip
(Li) should be 2 ± 1 mm anterior
to Sn – pog’ line.

Ls (Labrale Superius)
is a point
indicating the mucocutaneous
border of the upper lip.

is a cellulitis of
submaxillary submandibular
space and floor of the mouth. In
Ludwig’s angina submandibular
and submaxillary spaces are involved.

are involved. There is difficulty
in swallowing with varying degrees
of trismus. There develops
swelling of mouth. Structures in
floor or mouth are swollen and
tongue is pushed up and back.
Laryngeal edema may be
present. Swelling is firm, painful
and diffuse. Person is not able to
swallow or eat. Cavernous sinus
thrombosis and result in subsequent
meningitis. Antibiotics are
useful.

Lumbar puncture
is procedure,
where a hollow needle is inserted
into subarachnoid space between
L3 – L4 to avoid spinal cord. A
sample of CSF is withdrawn and
examined under microscope to
rule out pathologies.

Lumbar stenosis
vertebral canal
space inside the ring is greatest
when all the rings line up on top
of each other. These vertebrae
lines up best when you stoop
forward. Space gets smaller
when you stand up and smallest
when you bend backwards.
Arthritis or injury makes it
further smaller. People with
lumbar stenosis feel better when
their spine is bent forward.

Lupus erythromatosus
is a skin
condition. There may be a genetic
predisposition. There occur
many remissions and exacerbations.
Superficial painful ulceration
may occur with crusting or
bleeding. Margins of lesions are
not demarcated. Often white
straie radiate out from margins.
Central healing results in central
scarring.

Lupus milliaries disseminates faciei
develop dark red to brown
acneiform papules. These are
non tender brownish red papules.
There is no tendency to
form pustule. No foreign material
or remnants of microbes can
be detected.

Luting
is a mixing consistency of
cement which is used for bonding
or cementing two unlike substances
together.

Lymph node
performs biological
filtration of lymph on its way to
circulatory system. These are the
part of body network, which
filters antigen from tissue fluid
and lymph during its passage
from the periphery to the
thoracic duct. These are located
at branches of lymphatic vessels.
Human lymph nodes 1-25 mm in
diameter and round or kidney
shaped. Indentation is present on
the concave surface, where
efferent blood vessels leave the
node. Lymphatic afferent vessels
enter through the convex
surface. They have a collagenous
capsule, radial trabaculae, B-cell
rich cortex, T-cell rich paracortex
and a central medulla with T-cell,
B-cell and plasma cells. Para
cortex are rich in inter digitating
cells, APC, large quantity of
MHC class II antigen. Medullacords
separated by large sinuses
where scavenger phagocyte cells
along sinuses remove antigen
form lymph. Cortex-primary
and secondary follicles/
stimulated with germinal centers
contain dendritic APCs and
some macrophages. Involved
with development of B cell
response and B cell memory.

Lymphadenopathy
is a condition
occuring due to enlargement of
lymph node. In a lymph node
the B lymphocytes and T
lymphocytes occupy the
lymphoid follicles and
paracortical areas. Lymph node
enlargement occurs due to
increase in number and size of
lymphoid follicles, proliferation
of macrophages or infiltration by
abnormal cells. Enlargement of
lymph nodes more than 1 cm is
always pathological. Supra
auricular, supra clavicular
mesenteric glands and
mediastinal nodes are always
pathological. Lymphadenopathy
may be localized or generalized.

Lymphangioma
is a benign
neoplasm due to proliferation of
lymphatic vessels. It can be a
simple lymphangioma,
cavernous lymphangioma,
cellular and systemic
lymphangioma most of lesions
are present at birth. They are
similar to hemangioma except
the fact that these vessels are
filled with clear, protein rich
fluid containing a few cells.
Lymphangioma may occur in the
skin mucus membrane of head
and neck region. These may vary
in size. Lesion is composed of
numerous cytically dilated
cavernous, lymphatic spaces
many of which contain lymph. In
the neck it is known as cystic
hygroma. Mostly tongue is
involved. . These are not having
clear cut outline. Deeper lesions
appear as diffuse nodules. These
are painless, nodules or vesicle
like lesions over oral mucosa.
Color of lesion is lighter than
surrounding mucosa. On
palpation ‘crepitation’ sound is
produced. Lymphangioma of
tongue produces macroglossia.
Surgical excision is the treatment
of choice. It is radio resistant.

Lymphangitis
is the inflammation
of lymph vessels with pain in
limb, pyrexia and toxaemia. Pain
is throbbing or burning in
nature. Pain is felt along with
vessel. Superficial lymphatics of
upper or lower limb are affected.
Overlying skin may have edema.
Regional lymph nodes are
painful and enlarged. It is
frequently accompanied by
streptococcal or staphylococcal
infection mostly in distal arm of
leg. Malaise, sweating, chills and
fever of 37.5 to 40oc is noted.
Regional lymph nodes are
enlarged and tender. Lymphangitis
acute phase is seen in
pyogenic infections mostly due
to streptococci or other pyogenic
microorganism. Skin becomes
red and there is edema and
tenderness over area. It may
totally recover without any
sequlae. In the process of healing
the lymphatic may become
fibrosed.

Lymphedema
is anything that
obstructs the lymphatic vessel
causing edema of upper or lower
extremities. It involves dorsal
surfaces of hands and fingers or
the feet and toes. Erythema is
pitting initially and becomes
browny and non pitting. With
time ulceration, stasis and
pigmentation may develop. If it
persists it stimulates an
overgrowth of fibrous tissue and
has a brawny consistency and
does not pit on pressure.

Lymphocytes
are the primary
white blood cells involved in
immune response. These cells
recognize and respond to an
antigen. Lymphocytes are
derived from stem cell which is
located in bone marrow. These
constitute 20 to 25% white cells.
Two main types of lymphocytes
are called B-lymphocytes and
T-lymphocytes.

Lymphoepithelial cyst
appears as
a small, asymptomatic, well
circular and elevated nodule on
floor of mouth. It may be of a few
mm in size. Lesion consists of a
cavity lined by stratified
squamous epithelium. Lumen of
cyst contains lymphocytes and
amorphous coagulum. Treatment
includes local surgical
excision. It seldom recurs.

Lymphokines
are the products of
lymphocytes. They have
different functions. They can
help monocytes to be changed in
macrophages. They encourage
macrophages to remain in area
of injury to destroy foreign cells.

Lymphoproliferative disorders
are
characterized by monoclonal
proliferation and accumulation of
malignant lymphocytes. These
include lymphoblastic leukemia,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
and Non Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Lysis
is the destruction of cells
resulting from damage to the
plasma membrane.

includes development of
childhood gingival enlargement,
widened alveolar ridges and
widely spaced teeth. Certain
viscera’s are enlarged.

organelle visible by electron
microscopy that contains acid
hydrolases capable of breaking
down macromolecules. Lysosome
has diameters ranging from
50 nm to 1 m. A single membrane
consisting of a phospholipid
bilayer that undergoes selective
fusion with other membranous
organelles, an ATP driven h+
pump in the membrane, which
acidifies the lysosomal matrix to
ph 4.5–5.5, hydrolases in the inner
matrix that are active at acidic ph
and breakdown carbohydrates,
lipids, and proteins.

Macrodontia
is a
developmental
anomaly where one
or more teeth are
physically larger than
normal. This term
should not be used
when normal sized
teeth are crowded
with in a small jaw. In such cases,
the term Relative macrodontia is
more appropriate. Regional /
localized Macrodontia is occasionally
seen on the affected side of
the mouth in patients with Hemifacial
hypertrophy. Macrodontia
of single tooth is seen, but is rare.
Rhizomegaly/radiculomegaly
are an uncommon type of Macrodontia
in which the root/roots of
a tooth are considerably longer
than normal. This condition is
observed commonly in mandibular
canines. It is associated with
pituitary gigantism. Macrodontia
of single tooth is not very
common.

Macroglobulinemia
is a variant of
multiple myeloma. It develops in
old age. Person develops
weakness, lymphadenopathy and
enlargement of liver. Hemorrhage
from nasal cavity and oral
cavity develops. Oral ulcers on
tongue, buccal mucosa and
gingiva are seen. There is no
specific treatment.

Macroglossia
refers to enlarged
tongue. Congenital macroglossia
is due to over development of
tongue musculature. Secondary
macroglossia may be due to
diffuse lymphangioma or
hemangioma. It is found in
acromegaly too. There is no
particular treatment of it.

Macrognathia
refers to abnormally
large jaw. It may be associated
M with acromegaly and Paget’s
disease. Some cases follow
hereditary pattern. Prognathic
patient forms long rami with less
steep angle with body of
mandible. There will be increased
height of ramus, increased Gonial
angle, decreased maxillary
length, prominent chin button
and varying soft tissue contours.
Surgical correction is possible.

Macrolides
are broad-spectrum
antibiotics to which resistance
develops rapidly. They inhibit
protein synthesis by binding to
the ribosome and are bacteriostatic
at usual doses but bactericidal
in high doses.

Macrophages
are the monocytes
that have left the blood stream,
entered the tissues, and
differentiated into various
subpopulations. Many are found
in close proximity to blood
vessels. They are active in
endocytosis and phagocytosis.
Because of their mobility and
phagocytic activity, they are able
to act as scavengers, removing
extravasated red blood cells, dead
cells and foreign bodies from the
tissue.

Magill intubation forceps
is used
to grasp the objects which have
fallen into back of the patient’s
throat.

Magnesia core material
is
compatible with the high
expansion porcelains normally
bounded to metals.

Magnesium
is the essential trace
element. Human body contains
2000 mEq of magnesium. Half of
it is in bones and half is in soft
tissues. Highest concentration is
in liver and striated muscles.
Daily intake is 36-48 mg. Nuts,
peas, beans fruits and fish are rich
sources. Plasma magnesium
ranges from 1.5-2 mEq/L.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is an advanced diagnostic
aid and has the great advantage
over CT that the patient is not
subject to radiation. Anatomical
details are very well shown. Very
good pictures of spinal cord and
lumbar roots are seen. Different
pictures can be obtained by
varying the repetition time and
radio frequency signal (TR) T1W1
images better anatomical details
and T2W1 gives better pathological
findings.

Mahler’s theory (1933)
categorizes
the early childhood object relation
to understand personality
development. The period of
childhood is classified into three
stages: Normal autistic phase,
Normal symbiotic phase, Separation
individualization phase.

Maize
is a stable diet of poor class
Indians. It is rich in carbohydrate
and fat but is poor in essential
amino acid tryptophan. Due to
constant use of it may lead to
pellagra. Mixing of milk, egg or
wheat flour will help. Yellow
maize is rich in carotenoid
pigment.

Malaise
refers to any vague feeling
of illness, uneasiness or discomfort.

Malaria
is a type of fever occurring
with rigors. It has 3 stages: Cold
stage, hot stage, sweating stage.
Cold stage lasts 15 minutes to 2
hours and is followed by hot stage
in which fever may go very high.
On an average hot stage lasts for
4 – 8 hours. It is followed by
sweating stage which lasts for 1
to 4 hours. Patient may have
fever, vomiting and excessive
thirst. Patient feels exhausted. In
malignant malaria fever may be
accompanied by severe headache,
diarrhea and toxaemia. There
may be successive bouts of fever
followed by severe cachexia.
Splenic enlargement will be there
(see Figure on page 283).

Malformation
is a primary
structural defect that results from
a localized error in morphogenesis
e.g. peg shaped.

Malignant hypertension
is a
condition where patient may be
normotensive or hypertensive.
Both kidneys show flea bitten
appearance. In acute form kidney
may be swollen and pin point
hemorrhages may be seen.
Hypertension may result in
episodes of unconsciousness or
convulsions. Urine shows marked
proteinuria and hematuria.

Malignant hyperthermia
is a rapid
onset of extremely high fever with
muscle rigidity.

Malignant large intestine
is a
problem of rich society. Excessive
fat and deficient fibre are the
causative factor. Dietary fat
enhances bile acid synthesis and
level of sterol in intestine. Colonic
bacteria convert this sterol into
secondary acids which are
thought to be carcinogens.

Malignant lymphoma
is a
neoplastic proliferative process.
Lymphopoeitic portion of R.E.
system, lymphomas and
leukemias of lymphocytes and
histocytes are identical.

Malignant melanoma
develops
from melanocytes of skin or
mucous membrane. Although the
role of melanocytes is to protect
skin against development of skin
cancer, but the cancer arising
from the protective cell is most
malignant tumor. Sunlight
appears to play an important role
in producing it. Commonest sites
involved are hard palate and
gingiva. Most of the lesions are
pigmented and are dark brown in
color. It starts as macular
pigmented focal lesions. Initially
it grows very fast into large,
painful diffuse mass. Surface
ulceration is very common. Small
satellite lesions may develop at
periphery. There is wide spread
of tumor cells in lung, liver, bone
and brain. Radical surgery and
prophylactic neck dissection is
advised. Still survival chances are
bleak.
Malignant oral tumors
may
present as ulcers. Tobacco and
alcohol consumption may cause
squamous cell carcinoma. Oral
epithelial dysplasia and lichen
planus are the predisposing
factors. These become painful
when infected. Swollen non
tender glands in neck may be
seen. Loosening of teeth in
carcinoma of gingiva is seen.
Ulcer develops on tongue, floor
of mouth and buccal mucosa.
Shape may be round crescent or
irregular. Edges are raised, rolled
and everted. Base is indurated
and fixed. Floor is granular and
ragged.

Malignant salivary gland tumor
incidence is much low. Peripheral
malignant salivary gland tumors
can occur anywhere in lining of
oral cavity but seldom in gingiva.
Central variety is still rare.
It generally develops between the
age group 40-70 years of age. It
grows slowly. When tumor
infiltrates bone it produces
radiolucency.

Malignant Schwannoma
arises
from nerve sheath cell. Some may
develop from neurofibromatosis.
Complaint may be of a mass,
while some may develop pain.
Radiographs will show diffuse
radiolucency characteristic of
malignant infiltrating neoplasm.
It can be treated by surgery and
by radiation.

Malingerer
is the one who pretends
to be sick or in pain for a motive.

Malocclusion
is any deviation from
the ideal positioning of the teeth
or jaws.

Mamelons
are small elevations of
enamel present on the incisors as
they erupt.

Mandible
refers to the lower jaw.

Mammary duct ectasia
is a dilation
of collecting ducts in subareolar
region. It is a disease of at or about
menophase. Dilated ducts are
bluish in color about 3-5 mm.

Mandibular fracture
amounts to
20% of all fractures of face
condyle and angles are two most
commonly fracture sites. Multiple
fractures do take place.

Mandibular prognathism
can be
appreciated where a line
perpendicular to the constructed
horizontal is dropped from
glabella. The distance of softtissue

state of mind with overexcitement
and elevation of mood.

Mannitol
is an osmotic agent that
is freely filterable at the
glomerular level. It is not
reabsorbed by renal tubules. It
has high diuretic potential so
when given early in course of
acute renal failure it tends to flush
out cellular debris and prevent
tubular cast formation. Initial test
dose is 12.5 to 25 gm over 3.5
minutes. Repeat after 1-2 hours.
It is used in head injury. Mannitol
is also an artificial sweetener
occurring in seaweed, this alcohol
is metabolized very slowly by
oral microbes and therefore
thought to have less cariogenic
effect. It is used in toothpaste,
mouth rinses and as a dusting
agent in chewing gum.

Marasmus
is a disease occurring
due to protein energy malnutrition
or due to general starvation.
It arises from inadequate calorie
intake. There is a failure to gain
weight followed by loss of weight
until emaciation results. Skin

subcutaneous fat. Face becomes
shrunken and wizened like a
monkey. Abdomen may be
distended. There may be associated
vitamin deficiency.

Marginal gingiva
also known as
unattached gingiva is the terminal
edge of gingiva which surrounds
the teeth in a collar like fashion.
It also includes the gingival
crevice or the sulcus and a free
gingival margin. The free gingival
margin is thicker and rounded
around the primary teeth than in
the permanent teeth, due to the
morphological characteristics
such as the cervical bulge and the
underlying construction at the
cementogingival junction, in
contrast to the knife-edge margin
seen in permanent dentition.

Marginal gingivitis
is said to occur
where the marginal gingiva is
inflamed.

adapts well to the cavity wall and
disadvantage is the bridging and
surface pits are difficult to
prevent. Mat gold is no softer than
pure gold.

are a
family of metal binding
proteinases synthesized by
connective tissues cells and also
by hemopoietic cells including
monocytes and macrophages,
keratinocytes, endothelial cells
etc. They are usually secreted as
a proenzyme form requiring extracellular
activation. Metalloproteinase’s
can synergistically digest
all the macromolecules of tissue
matrices, although they are not
necessarily produced together in
any specific situations. Major sub
groups of MMPS are -> Interstitial
collagenases (MMP1, 8 and 13),
Gelatinases (MMP 2 and 9),
Stromelysins (MMP 3, 10, and 11),

lesions develop 2-3 days earlier of
cutaneous rash. Intraoral lesions
are known as Koplik’s spot. These
spots occur on buccal mucosa and

appearing as bluish white specks
surrounded by bright red margin.

Mechanical antidotes
are those
drugs that inactive poisons by
mechanical action. Finally

epithelium along the line of fusion
of palatal process of maxilla. It lies
in midline of hard palate. It
requires surgical removal and
curettage.

Median Rhomboid Glossitis
is a
congenital anomaly occuring due
to failure of tuberculum impar to
withdraw before fusion of 2 hours
of tongue hence a structure
devoid of papillae lies in between
them. It is seen as an ovoid or
rhomboid shaped reddish patch
on dorsum of tongue anterior to
circum vallate papillae. It is flat
but slightly raised area.

Medical ethics
are the special rules
and regulations from the point of
view of morality which a medical

responsible for the normal
pigmentation of skin, hair,
gingiva and the rest of the oral
mucous membrane. It is generally
present in all individual and is
very prominent in black
individuals.

Melanocytes
are the dendritic cells
present in the basal and the
spinous layer of gingival epithelium.
They are mainly responsible
for the production of a pigment
called melanin which consequently
attributes to the darker
pigmented gingiva.

Melasma
is a facial hypopigmentation
seen commonly in
pregnancy. There will be blotchy
macules involving cheeks, temples
and forehead. Sunlight increases
the pigmentation while at the end
of pregnancy it dissolves out. It
may also develop during the use
of oral contraceptive.

Melatonin
is an important
hormone produced by pineal
gland believed to regulate onset
of puberty and menstrual cycle.

Memory cell
are the cells that
remain in reserve in lymph nodes
until their ability to secrete
antibodies is needed.

Menarche
is the beginning of
menstrual function or it is the first
menstruation which marks the
onset of puberty in the female. It
usually occurs between the age of
11 to 16 years.

Meningeal carcinomatosis

to a condition where diffuse
infiltration of meninges occurs in
8% of patients with advanced
malignancy. Lesions such as
lymphoma, melanoma and
adenocarcinoma of breast are
noted. Seizures and cranial nerve
palsy are noted.

Meningioma
is a tumor of arachoid
cell of meninges. These are well
circumscribed extra axial lesions
that causes symptoms due to
mass effect on under lying
structures. These are completely
resectable. Calcification in these is
sufficient to make it radio opaque.
On CT (Computed Tomography)
these are seen as well defined
hyperdense solid mass.

Meningitis
is a condition occuring
due to infection of meninges,
brain stem and spinal cord
covered by 3 membranes from
within outwards, pia mater,
arachnoid and dura mater.
Organisms can enter meninges
from without by penetrating
wounds, from extension from
brain abscess and through blood
stream. One develops fever,
diffuse headache, vomiting, and
neck stiffness and in children
convulsions may be developed.

Menopause
is the period during
which menstruation ceases and
female reproductive cycle comes
to an end. Contrary to certain
fears sexual desire and enjoyment
are maintained.

Mental health
is not mere absence
of mental illness. Mental health is
a state of balance between the
individual and surrounding
world, a state of harmony
between oneself and others,
coexistence between realties of
self and that of other people and
that of the environment.

Mental nerve
is the branch of
inferior alveolar nerve which exits
in mandible through its foramen.
It innervates chin and mucus
membrane of lower lip.

Mentalis
is conical muscle present
at the side of frenulum of lower
lip. It raises and protrudes the
lower lip and wrinkles the skin of
chin.

Mentalis space
refers to the space
existing in the region of mental
symphysis, where the mental
muscle, depressor muscle of the
lower lip and the angle of the
mouth are attached. Infection to
this area results in the large
swelling of the chin.

Meprobamate
is a common
propanediol derivative used in
treatment of anxiety and tension.
It acts as muscle relaxant too, but
is less potential than diazepines.
It reduces muscle tone but can
cause tolerance and physical
dependence. It produces sleep,
ataxia and hypotension.

Mercury alloy ratio
is the ratio of
amongst of mercury to be mixed
with an amalgam alloy.

Mercury
is a metal, component of
amalgam fillings.

Mercury poisoning
occurs due to
fatal dose of 3-5 grams of
mercuric chloride and fatal
period is 3-5 days. Symptoms
include metallic taste in mouth
with a feeling of constriction and
chocking in throat. It is followed
by burning sensation. Mucus
membrane becomes white and
swollen. Vomits may contain
mucous with blood. Stools
become watery with mucus and
blood. As treatment B.A.L. 300
mgm 1 M at once followed by 150
mgm during next 12 hours.

formed by the intersection of
Frankfort horizontal (FH) and a
line connecting the soft-tissue
chin (Pog’) and the most
protrusive lip point of upper or
lower lip. Average value,
80 degree (±9).

Mesh size
is a numerical grading
of particle size. larger numbers
e.g. 320 denote fine particles and
smaller numbers denote coarse
particles.

Mesial
is the surface of the tooth
nearest the midline of the dental
arch. Mesial is toward the
midline.

Mesial step terminal plane
is a
type of relationship where the
distal surface of the lower second
deciduous molar is more mesial
than that of the upper. Thus the
permanent molar erupts directly
into ‘Angles’ Class I occlusion.
This type of mesial step terminal
plane must commonly occur due
to the early forward growth of the
mandible. If the differential
growth of the mandible in a
forward growth persists it can
lead to Angles Class III molar
relation and if the forward
mandibular growth is minimal it
can establish a Class I molar
relationship.

Mesiodens
is the most common
supernumerary tooth located
between maxillary central
incisors near the midline. Also
refer supernumerary teeth.

Meta analysis
in it research results
across several different studies
are synthesized in a quantitive
way.

Metabolic acidosis
occurs due to
loss of alkalies from the kidney.
In mild case it may be
asymptomatic while in severe
case patient may develop
hyperpnea. Cardinal clinical
findings include hyperventilation.
There will be increased
depth and respiration frequency.
Lips will become dry and parched
tongue may be present especially
in diabetic acidosis. Acidosis
depresses cardiac response to
catecholamines. It reduces red
cells. Anorexia and fatigue are
common. Confusion and stupor
may occur. In acute renal failure
organic acid retention cause fall
in plasma bicarbonate by 1-2
mEq/L/day. Patient may have
circulatory shock.

Metabolic alkalosis
develops due
to loss of acids from kidneys or
stomach. It has raised plasma
bicarbonate and pH. There is mild
rise in PaCO2. Urine pH below 7.
Urine chloride less than 10 mE/
Q1L. There may be tetany, apathy
and confusion.

Metal ceramic crowns
are the type
of crowns where the dental
porcelain can be bonded to
variety of metal alloys. These
alloys fall into three categories:
precious metal alloys, semiprecious
metal alloys and base
metal alloys. The advantages of
these crowns are strength,
minimal palatal reduction,
adaptability; wherein the disadvantages
includes aesthetics,
strength, loss of tooth substance
and the cost.

Metal
is a crystalline material that
consists of positively charged ions
in an ordered closely packed
arrangement and bonded with a
cloud of free electrons.

Metalizing
is a coating of
impression material with a
powdered metal to make it
electrically conductive.

Metallic stains due to drugs
are
generalized unlike other stains
and may affect all the surfaces of
the tooth, these drugs enter the
plaque substance and impart its
color to plaque and calculus e.g.
consumption of iron will give rise
to black or brown stains,
manganese will give rise to black
stains.

Metallic stains due to industries
occur mastly on the cervical third
of the anterior teeth are primarily
affected by the inhalation of
metallic dust through mouth
bringing them in contact with
teeth, these metals along with
bacterial plaque impart their color
to the plaque present which
occasionally may penetrate the
tooth substance and give rise to
endogenous stains. Copper will
give bluish green stains, nickel
will give green stain, and
cadmium will give yellow or
golden brown stains.

Metamerism
is the change in color
matching of two objects under
light source is called Metamerism.
Two objects that are marched
under one light source but not
under other light source forms
metameric pair.

Metaplasia
is conversion of one
type of differentiated tissue into
another type of differentiated
tissue. Metaplasia can be of
epithelial or connective tissue
type. Metaplasia of columnar to
squamous epithelium occurs in
respiratory mucosa.

Metastasis
is a spread of tumor
from one site of organ to another
with no direct continuity with the
main or primary tumor mass.
Tumor thus formed is a secondary
deposit. Metastatic spread can
occur through lymphatic channels,
blood vessels. Metastatic
spread is the hall mark of malignant
neoplasm. Benign tumors
never metastasize.

Metastasis melanomatous nodes
patient is a young person between
20 to 30 years. Lymph nodes are
firm, massive but not tender.
These are mobile in early stage
but later become fixed.

Metastatic calcification
is the
deposition of calcium in normal
viable tissue due to hypercalcemia.
It is due to hyperparathyroidism,
vitamin D
intoxication and osteolytic bone
secondaries. Gastric mucosa,
lungs, blood vessels and kidneys
are involved. Deposition is
around the tubules in kidney.

Metastatic carcinomatous nodes
are the solitary or multiple nodes
involved. It is hard but not tender.
To start these are mobile and
fixed. It may macerate or fungate.
Primary lesion may be known.

Metastatic liver neoplasm
Metastatic
tumors are much more
common. Cancer of breast,
stomach, pancreas, kidney, and
uterus are most to metastasize.
Weight loss, anorexia and fatigue
are the common complaints. CT
scan is a better tool to diagnose it.
Survival is 3 months to 3 years.

Metastatic tumors of jaw
are
formed by cells that have been
transported from the primary
tumor to site not connected to
original tumor. These are not
frequent and may be
asymptomatic. If mandibular
nerve is involved there may be
paresthesia of lip or chin. Teeth
may become loose. Expansion of
jaw is a constant finding. Mandible
is affected more than maxilla. On
X-ray these produce metastatic
lesion. Diffuse destruction may
lead to pathological fracture.
Prognosis is not good.

Metastatic vertebral tumor
causes
low back pain. Typically pain
begins abruptly with cramping
muscular pain. Pain is worst
during night and is not relieved
by rest.

Methadone
was discovered in 1940
in Germany and produces mild
analgesia. It is well absorbed form
G.I.T. Its effective oral dose is
5-15 mg depending on severity of
pain. Side effects are less common.

Methohexltone
is two and half
times more potent drug as
thiopentone. It is prepared by
mixing the powder in sterile
distilled water. Average induction
dose is 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg body
weight. It is the best anesthetic
induction agent. It can be best
used singly for extraction of tooth.
If it is injected extravenously it
may cause necrosis and ulcer
formation.

Metronidazole
is a gram negative
antimicrobial that is active against
wide range of micro-organism
specially trichomonads. It is used
in ulcerative gingivitis. It is well
tolerated when given orally
except some G.I.T. upsets.

Micro abrasion
is a drill-free
technique using an instrument
resembling a tiny sand blaster that
delivers tiny aluminium oxide
particles to the surface of teeth.

Microangiopathy
is the
abnormalities in the structure and
function of blood vessel.

Microdontia
is a developmental
anomaly where the teeth are
physically smaller than usual.
Widely spaced normal sized teeth
may appear small within the jaws
that are larger than normal and is
termed as relative microdontia.
But this in true sense represents
macrognathia, not microdontia. If
all the teeth in both the normal
sized arches are smaller than
normal it is referred to as
generalized microdontia. True
generalized microdontia is seen in
pituitary dwarfism, Down’s
syndrome. Isolated microdontia/
microdontia involving one or two
teeth are far more common than
generalized types. Most
commonly affected teeth are
maxillary, lateral incisor or
maxillary third molars. Maxillary
lateral incisors typically appear
peg shaped crown.

Microfilled composite resins
Conventional resins are 500 times
greater than that of particles in
microfilled resin. Some pulpal
protection is necessary under
deep cavities.

Micrognathia
means a small jaw.
Either a maxilla or mandible may
be affected. True micrognathia
may be congenital or acquired. In
case of maxilla deformity is of
middle third of face retracted.
Congenital micrognathia is
difficult to explain. Acquired type
is due to disturbance of
temporomandibular joint. There
is severe retrusion of chin, steep
mandibular angel and deficient
chin button.

Micron

amperage electricity.

Microstomia
is a condition where
patient present with an
abnormally small opening of
mouth associated with functional
disability. Shape of opening is
circular and it appears as if patient
is whistling. It may be congenital
or may develop after burns.

Microwave diathermy
is a therapy
where microwaves penetrate
more deeply than infrared rays
but don’t pass through the tissues
in any appreciable density. This
is not suitable for treatment of
deeply placed structures than
short wave diathermy. Average
depth of penetration is 3 cm.
These are effectively absorbed by
water so there is an appreciable
heating of tissues having rich
blood supply. It is very good in
traumatic and inflammatory
lesions. So it is useful in trauma
and rheumatic condition. Skin
must be dry because water is
heated rapidly. Wet dressings
should be avoided.

Mid sagittal plane
is also known
as midline vertical plane that
divides the body into two equal
left and right halves.

Middle cerebral artery ischemia
is
the largest branch of internal
carotid artery and supplies the
lateral surfaces of frontal, parietal
and temporal lobes. Complete
occlusion results in contralateral
sensory loss, motor weakness
with positive Babinski sign of
upper motor neurone lesion.

Middle superior nerve
is a branch
of infraorbital nerve within the
infra orbital canal, provides
sensory innervations to maxillary
premolars, periodontal tissue
facial soft tissue and bone.

Midline
is the imaginary line
through the middle of an object
which divides it into two equal
parts.

Miescher’s syndrome
is manifested
as diffuse swelling of lip. Scaling,
fissuring, vesicle or pustule
formation of vermillion border
may take place.

Migraine
is a familial disorder
characterized by recurrent
paroxysmal attacks of headache
it is one of the most disabling
disease. Often there is a strong
family history. It is a paroxysmal
unilateral headache, preceded by
visual and sensory phenomena. It
may be accompanied by nausea
and vomiting. It is due to
vasospasm in extra and intra
cranial arteries. It starts just after
waking up. Visual aura is
common. It may be hemianopic
field defect and transient
blindness. Sensory aura includes
tingling, numbness and pins and
needles in corner of mouth.
Treatment is disappointing.

Migraine without aura
is of an
abrupt onset. Nausea and
vomiting are common. It is
strongly familial. Headache may
awaken patient from sleep.
Photophobia and homophobia
are common. In status migrainous
hospitalization may be needed.

Migratory glossititis
is also known
as wondering rash of tongue of
unknown etiology. Emotional
stress may result in it. It shows
multiple areas of desquamation
of filiform papillae in an
irregular pattern. Central portion
looks inflamed, while borders
are outlined by thin yellowish
white line. Area of desquamation
heals and appear at other location.
It gives an idea of migration.
Condition may remain for
months. Since the etiology is
unknown treatment is empirical.

Mikulicz’s disease
shows both
inflammatory and neoplastic
characteristics. There is enlargement
of parotid or sub maxillary
gland. There may be fever, loose
tooth and oral infection. Mass
may increase or decrease in size.

Military tuberculosis lung
is due
to hematogenous spread of
infection. X-ray may show small,
discrete nodules 1-2 mm. in
diameter distributed throughout
both lungs. These nodules may
enlarge and coalesce (see Figure
on page 300).

Milk
is a complete and ideal food
and is a balanced diet. It contains
3.5% proteins. Carbohydrates are
in form of milk sugar. Human
milk contains more sugar than
cow’s milk. It is a poor source of
vitamin C and does not contain
vitamin E. It is a good source of
calcium but is a poor source of
iron. Fat is in the form of
glycerides in emulsified form.

Mineral elements
are the trace
elements found in body. There are
24 minerals. About 4-6% of body
weight is made up of mineral
elements. Bones and teeth store
these. These maintain acid base
balance, control of water balance,
contraction of muscles and
clotting of blood. This helps in
formation of bone and teeth
formation.

Mini bladed curettes
are the
modification of extended shank
or after five curettes. They are half
the size of standard Gracey
curettes; they have shorter blades
which allow easier insertion and
adaptation into deep pockets,
furcation areas, developmental
grooves etc.

Mini plates
were introduced by
champy et al in 1978 customized
for mandibular fractures. They
were initially available in stainless
steel which has now been
replaced by titanium. These non
compression mini plates are
confined to outer cortex allowing
the fixation of plates both sub
apically and the lower border.
After healing these plates can be
left in vicinity permanently
without causing any trouble.

Minor oral surgery instruments
include scalpal, periosteal
elevator, tissue retractor, kilner
cheek retractor and Austin
retractor.

Minor salivary gland
are found
deep to the mucosa of the upper
and lower lip, cheeks, undersurface
of the tongue, soft palate,
dorsal surface of the tongue and
lateral parts of hard palate behind
the first premolar. These small
glands have short ducts which
open directly onto the surface of
the mucosa by multitude of
openings.

Mismatched blood transfusion
refers to where patient of a particular
group has been transfused
another group of blood. Person
develops fever with rigor. There
develop pain with rigor in
pericardium area. B.P. falls and
pulse goes high. Skin becomes
cold and clammy with cyanosis.
Urine becomes scanty.

Mitotic activity
is a process of cell
division. It determines the
response of a cell to radiation.

Mitotic figures
are seen in any
proliferative tissue including
benign tumors. A high mitotic
index is not diagnostic of
malignancy. Abnormal mitotic
figures such as triploid and tetra
polar mitoses occur exclusively in
malignant lesion.

Mitral regurgitation
occurs when
left atrial pressure rises rapidly
leading to pulmonary edema.
When chronic, left atrium
enlarges, exertional dyspnea and
fatigue progresses. Mitral
regurgitation may predispose to
infective endocarditis. There will
be pan systolic murmur maximal
at apex radiating to axilla.

Mitral stenosis
There will be
dyspnea, orthopnea and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Prominent mitral first sound,
opening snap and apical diastolic
crescendo. ECG shows left atrial
abnormality.

Mixed dentition
is a type of
dentition that contains both the
dentition as this is the transient
phase where there is exchange of
primary dentition to permanent
dentition. It is also known as
transitional dentition.

Mixing tip
is used with an authmix
impression system.

Mm Hg
Millimeters of mercury a
unit measuring pressure.

Mode
is the most frequently
occurring score within a
distribution.

Moderate bone loss
of 10 to 33%
measured on a dental radiograph.

Moderate interproximal lesion
extends greater than halfway
through the thickness of enamel,
but does not involve the dentero
enamel junction (DEJ). A moderate
lesion is seen in enamel only.

Moderate periodontitis
is said to
have occurred when the
periodontal destruction is 3 to
4 mm of clinical attachment.

Moderate pulpalgia
may start
spontaneously from such a simple
act as that of lying down. Hot
food or drink excites the pain.
Warm water will not relieve the
pain and cold water sometimes
makes it worse. The pain is a true
toothache. Pain is of nagging or
of boring type. Pain to start is
localized and later becomes
diffuse or referred to another
area. Pain does not resolve once
the irritant is removed.

Modified DMFT Index
was
introduced by Joseph Z Anaise in
1983. The DMFT index Klein and
Palmer is one of the simplest and
most commonly used indices in
epidemiologic dental health
status based on the number of
decayed, missing and filled teeth.
The index however does not
provide an accurate description of
previous dental care nor does it
provide information regarding
the severity of the carious attack
or the indicated treatment. Thus,
a modification of the DMFT index
was developed. The modification
of DMFT index involved a
division of the ‘D’ component into
four separate categories. With the
addition of these categories, the
index remains simple, and yet
provides description of one’s
previous dental experience. It
further shows the extents of
dental services needed by the
population, which can be
interpreted in terms of treatment
hours and costs. Basically, this
modified DMFT index involves
the same operation procedures
applied to the common DMFT
index. The only difference is the
scoring criteria for ‘D’ component
of the index. In this modified
DMF index, the ‘D’ component is
divided into 4 separate categories.

Modified pen grasp
ensures the
greatest control in performing
intraoral procedures. The thumb,
index and the middle finger is
used to hold the instrument as a
pen is held. This grasp enhances
control because it enables the
clinician to roll the instrument in
precise degrees, also it enhances
tactile sensitivity.

Modulus of elasticity
is a measure
of materials stiffness. Stiffness is
an important issue when selecting
restorative materials because
large deflections are undesirable.
To withstand forces of mastication
material should have high
modulus of elasticity.

Moist heat sterilization
denatures
and coagulates the protein of
microbe. It is highly efficient due
to latent heat of vaporization
present in moist heat. Portable
steam sterilizers are being used.

Molar forceps
are the surgical
instruments to perform extraction.
These have pointed blades to fit the
bifurcation of molar roots. Upper
molar forceps have one pointed
blade to fit the bifurcation of
buccal roots and a rounded blade
to fit the single palatal root. Lower
molar forceps have two identical
blades. Left and right lower molars
are extracted with it (see Figure on
page 303).

Molar
is the posterior most teeth of
the oral cavity. They have large
occlusal table and play a major
role in chewing. There are first,
second and third molars; these are
the sixth, seventh and eighth teeth
from the center of the mouth,
respectively. Third molars are
also known as wisdom tooth.

Molecular death
means death of an
individual cells or tissues of body.
It takes sometime after the
somatic death. The period
between somatic death and cell
death is rarely more than 3-4
hours. Signs of molecular death
include loss of elasticity of skin,
changes in eyes, cooling of body,
flaccidity and lately rigor mortis.

Moller’s Index
is a system that was
developed by Moller I.J and
Poulsen S in 1964 is a standardized
system for diagnosing,
recording and analyzing dental
caries data. The basis for the
development of this system was
to make available a system which
could be used in many different
situations. The advantages of the
system seems to be its flexibility
in meeting the varying needs of
different types of clinical studies
on dental caries.

Molluscum contagiosum
is due to
infection with a large DNA virus,
a member of pox virus group.
It causes small umbilicated 1-3
mm in diameter lesion which may
express cheesy core on pressure.
It is more common in children.
Multiple, discrete elevated
nodules occur on face and trunk.
Disease appears to be spread by
autoinoculation. Oral lesions
occur on lips, tongue and buccal
mucosa, surgical excision may be
required.

Monellin
is 3000 times sweeter than
sucrose. It is extracted from an
African berry. Like Aspartame, it
is a protein–derived sweetener.

Monocytes
are the largest normal
cell in blood. Nucleus may be
round, kidney shaped, oval or
lobulated. Cytoplasm is slightly
grey. Chromatin is arranged in
fine strands with sharply defined
margins. It is also of same size as
that of Neutrophils, i.e. 10 mm
diameter but they are conventionally
known as macrophages
when they leave the blood as they
began to differentiate and grow
larger in size up to 22 mm
diameter. They are best suited for
communicating with lymphocytes
and other surrounding cells.

Monomorphic adenoma
is a
benign encapsulated salivary
gland. These are composed of
uniform pattern of epithelial cells.
These have no connective tissue
like component. These are treated
surgically.

Moral values
are standards of
conduct and are influenced by
family, religion, culture and
society.

Morbidity
is sickness/illness.

Morgue
is the area where dead
bodies are temporarily held or
examined.

Morning sickness
develops in
early pregnancy. Nausea and
vomiting is seen. It may be due
to hypoglycaemia.

Moro reflex
is any sudden
movement of the neck initiates the
reflex. This can be elicited by
pulling the baby to a sitting
position from the supine and
suddenly let the head fall back to
a short distance. This reflex
consists of a rapid abduction and
extension of the arm with the
opening of hands. This gives an
indication of muscle tone. The
response may be asymmetrical if
muscle tone is unequal on the two
sides, or if there is a weakness of
an arm or an injury to the clavicle.
This reflex usually disappears in
2 to 3 months.

Morphine
is an opioid drug that
was first isolated in 1903 by
Serturner. It is derived from
papaver somniferu. It chiefly
affects CNS and bowels. 5-10 mg
I.V. reduces pain within 20-30
minutes. There develop a feeling
of drowsiness and euphoria. It is
effective against all types of pain
but not very effective in sharp
intermittent pain. It depresses
respiration. Cough reflex is also
depressed and death is due to
respiratory failure. Itching and
urticaria may also develop. It
develops tolerance and physical/
psychical dependence. Heroin is
more effective than morphine.

Morphology
is the science that
deals with form and structure
without reference of function.

Mortal Pulpotomy
Ideally, a nonvital
tooth should be treated by
pulpectomy and root canal filling.
However, pulpectomy of a
primary molar is often impracticable
and a two-stage pulpotomy
technique is therefore more
commonly used. Necrotic coronal
pulp is first removed and the
infected radicular pulp is treated
with a strong antiseptic solution,
which is applied on a cotton pellet
and sealed in the pulp chamber
for 10-12 weeks. Beech wood
creosote is usually used (Hobson
1970) 52 but formocresol (Droter
1963) or camphorated monochlorophenol
may also be used.
Beech wood creosote is a mixture
of cresol, glycol and other
phenols, which is less irritant to
the tissue than phenol itself.

Mortality
means death.

Moss hypothesis
according to
moss states that the “bone” does
not regulate its own growth. The
genetic and epigenetic determines
of matrix, are, muscle, nerve
glands, teeth, neurocranial fossa,
and nasal, orbital, oral, and
pharyngeal cavities. This is
primary while the growth of the
skeletal unit is secondary.
However, although the functional
matrix principle describes what
happens during growth, it does
not account for how it happens.
Functional matrices, which can be
further, divided in to capsular
and perosteal matrices have the
primary control for the growth of
cranio-facial structures. Bone
responds to the matrices in a
passive manner and doesn’t have
any primary growth potential.

Motor neuron
transmits nerve
impulses from brain and spinal
cord to muscles and glandular
epithelial tissue.

Mottled enamel
was described first
by F. McKay in 1916. Ingestion of
fluoride containing drinking
water during the formation of
tooth leads to it. Severity of it
increases with increasing amount
of fluoride. Above the level of 0.9
to 1.0 ppm fluoride may cause it.
Mild changes manifest by white
opaque areas. Moderate and
severe change shows pitting and
brownish staining. Fracture
enamel may be seen. Bleaching of
affected teeth gives cosmetic
relief.

Mottling fluoride
is endemic in
areas where fluorides in drinking
water exceeds 2 ppm. It has a
geographical distribution and
permanent teeth are affected.
Mottling of deciduous teeth is
rare. Mottled teeth are less
susceptible to caries. Mottling
ranges from paper white patches
to opaque, brown, pitted and
brittle enamel.

Mould
is a cavity into which molten
metal is cast.

Mouth breathing
is an oral habit
where mouth has been attributed
as a possible etiologic factor for
malocclusion. The mode of
respiration influences the position
of the jaw, the tongue and to a
lesser extent the head. Mouth
breathing can result in altered jaw
and tongue posture, which could
alter the oro-facial equilibrium
thereby leading to malocclusion.
It can be obstructive, habitual or
anatomic in nature. Classified into
a. Obstructive, b. Habitual,
c. Anatomic.

Mouth guard
is a removable
appliance used to protect teeth
from injury during sports.

Mouth rinse
reduces the number
of intraoral microbes by as much
as 50 percent. There is an element
of mechanical removal and
reduction due to antiseptic too.
Chlorhexidine is commonly used.

Mucin
is a secretion of mucus cell
a polysaccharide protein which
when combined with water forms
a lubricating solution.

Mucocele
is a clinical term used to
describe swelling caused by
pooling of saliva at the site of
damage or obstruction. It is
generally of traumatic origin. It is
of 2 types (i) extravasation of
mucocele or (ii) retention
mucocele. It generally occurs on
lower lip palate, cheek and
tongue. Lesions may be fairly
deep in tissue. Superficial lesion
is a raised circumscribed vesicle
Mucus extravasation type is
common mucocele and is caused
by laceration. Mucus retention
type is due to obstruction
resulting in cyst formation.
Mucoceles show flattened
epithelial lining. Treatment
includes excision.

Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome
is a self limiting febrile
illness. Etiology is not known.
Clinical features include fever for
5-7 days, bilateral conjunctivitis,
and peripheral edema. Acute non
purulent swelling consist of
cervical lymph nodes of 1.5 cms.
Majority of cases are self limiting.

Mucoepidermoid tumor
is an
unusual type of malignant
salivary gland neoplasm with
varying degree of aggressiveness.
Tumor generally involves parotid
gland. It is similar to pleomorphic
adenoma, it is a slow growing,
painless swelling, it has cystic
feeling, X-ray will show
unilocular or multilocular
radiolucent areas in jaw, parotid
tumor shows relatively, focal
nodular swelling, swelling is
mobile, facial nerve paralysis may
develop, low grade tumor shows
fluctuation, but high grade
tumors are fixed to the adjacent
areas, in a few cases tumor may
be fast growing with ulceration,
hemorrhage and paresthesia.

Mucogingival surgery
is the term
given to describe the surgical
procedures that were performed
for the correction of relationship
between the gingiva and oral
mucous membrane with the
reference to specific problems
associated with attached gingiva,
shallow vestibules and frenum
involving marginal gingiva.

Mucomycosis
is caused by an
infection with a saprophytic
fungus. Fungus is generally non
pathogenic. It occurs normally in
soil or as a mould on decaying
food. There is development of
ulcerative lesions. Denudation of
underlying bones may develop.
Negative cultures don’t rule out
the disease. Microscopically
necrosis may be seen. Fungus
invades arteries resulting in
thrombosis and ischemia. Fungus
may spread from oral and nasal
area to brain causing death. In
oral cavity it results in ulceration
of palate resulting necrosis.
Ulcers may develop on gingiva,
lip and alveolar ridge. Treatment
includes surgical debridement of
an infected area with Amphotericin–B for 3 months.

Mucoperiosteum
is the soft oral
tissue covering the bone that
consists of mucosa and the
periosteum.

Mucosa
is the thin, outer pink or
red membrane lining the inside of
the oral cavity.

Mucositis
is the direct cytotoxic
action of chemotherapeutic
agents on the oral mucosa
resulting in atrophy or thinning
of oral mucosa, erythema and
ulceration.

Mucous membrane pemphigoid
is
an autoimmune disease affecting
eye, skin and oral mucosa.
Symptoms include painful, blood
filled blisters which rupture to
form ulcer. Rupture bullae is
having well defined margins.
Floor is having an inflamed base.

Mulberry molar
is a developmental
anomaly of teeth that is
suggestive of congenital syphilis.
Buccal and lingual surfaces are
normal but occlusal surfaces
looks like mulberry.

Multilocular cyst
is the most
frequently encountered entity in
jaws. It is always of soap bubble
type. It is a true cyst of jaws. Small
cyst is usually asymptomatic. It
increases slowly and may cause
displacement of teeth. Root can be
resorbed. If the overlying bone
becomes thin it may produce
crackling sound. Later covering
plate may be destroyed. It may
contain thin, straw colored fluid.

Multilocular lesion
is the one
which extends beyond the
confines of one distinct area and
is defined as many lobes.
Odontogenic keratocysts is an
example of multi ocular lesion.

Multilocular radiolucencies
are
produced by multiple adjacent
frequently coalescing and
overlapping compartments in
bone. Mostly these occur in
maxilla. The term soap bubble,
honeycombs and tennis racket are
frequently used.

Multiple endocrine neoplasias
are
also known as MEN syndrome. It
is inherited as an autosomal
dominant. The lesion involves
certain endocrine glands. They
produce bumpy lips. Anterior 1/
3rd of tongue is involved. These
appear as tortuous masses of
nerve fibres.

Multiple fractures
refer to the
fractures occurring at various
sites resulting from single injury.
The most common one is caused
by the fall on the midpoint of chin
resulting in fractures of
symphysis and both the condyle.

Multiple myeloma
develops from
bone marrow resembling to
plasma cell. IL-6 is the major
myeloma growth and C-reactive
protein is a peripheral marker of
1L-6. It develops in elderly age
group. Pain is the early feature.
Back pain, anemia and bone pain
are common. Any movement
increases pain. Pain is due to
osteoclastic lesion. Collapse of
vertebra or of a long bone is due
to lytic lesion. Pathological
fracture is common. Bence Jones
proteinuria develops along with
unexplained weakness, fatigue,
osteoporosis. Ramus angle and
molar region of mandible are the
commonest sites involved. X-ray
will show multiple sharply
punched out areas. Size may vary
from a few mm. to 1 cm. There is
no peripheral bone reaction. It
infiltrates bone and soft tissue.
Bones anywhere in the body can
be affected. Deep bone pain is the
early feature. Pain increases with
movement. Numbness of chin
and lips may develop. Jaw
swelling and pain may be
confused with toothache. Jaw
swelling, crackling or pathological
fracture may develop.
Extraction of teeth results in
severe hemorrhage. Radiographs
will show numerous punched out
areas of radiolucency with
peripheral bone reaction.
Chemotherapy is given but
disease is fatal.

Multiple organ failure
is the
condition in which two or more
organ system gradually cease to
function.

Mumps
is an acute contagious viral
infection. There is unilateral or
bilateral swelling of parotid
glands. Submaxillary and
sublingual glands may be
involved. Incubation period is
2-3 weeks. Disease is preceded by
chill, fever, pain below ear. Later
on swelling becomes firm and
rubbery. Complications include,
orchitis, pancreatitis and Otitis.
Orchitis is unilateral and serum
amylase level is increased.

Mumps-vaccine
is highly effective
live attenuated vaccine is
available for prevention of
mumps. Single dose 0.5 ml. I.M.
produces detectable antibodies in
95% cases. It should not be given
to pregnant women or in severely
ill patient.

Muscle relaxants
are neuromuscular
blocking agents producing
their effect by interfering with the
excitatory action of acetylcholine
at the motor end plate. These
provide paralysis of voluntary
muscles during clinical anesthesia.
These are of two types,
(i) non depolarizing neuromuscular
blocking agents and
(ii) depolarizing neuromuscular
blocking agents.

Muscle splinting pain
is defined as
rigidity of muscles occurring as a
means of avoiding pain caused by
movement of a part. Muscle
splinting is involuntary contraction
that tends to immobilize the
part. At rest a splinted muscle
relaxes. Splinting of masticatory
muscles occurs as a protective
mechanism to limit excessive
functioning of TM joint.

Muscle strain
causes mild to severe
pain with movement. The
reduction of movement may
cause muscle weakness and
atrophy.

Muscular contact position (MCP)
refers to that position of mandible
where the mandible is lifted into
contact from resting position.

Musculoskeletal pain
is noninflammatory
in origin. It results
from muscles spasm, it is reactive,
and it is protective. Muscles
splinting is a temporary
protective mechanism. Such
splinting serves to rest the muscle
until the symptoms disappear.

Mutism
is a total inability to speak.
It may be seen without any
organic disease of CNS. It may be
psychogenic in origin.

Mycobacterium leprae
Humans
are the only hosts. These reside in
skin and nerves. Prolonged contact
is required for transmission.
It is aerobic, acid fast bacilli. These
are not alcohol fast and no known
toxins. Leprosy bacillus causes
slow progressive chronic disease
affecting skin and nerves.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis
is
responsible for tuberculosis (TB)
and is found in infected humans
mainly in lungs. Spread is by
droplet. It is acid and alcohol fast,
slender, beaded bacilli. Ziehl –
Nelson stain is required to see
them.

Myeloblast
is round and large,
about 14 to 18 micro mm in
diameter. Nucleus is very fine of
the cell. Nuclear chromatin is very
fine and two to five nucleoli are
present. Cytoplasm is basophilic.
Myeloid is pertaining to bone
marrow.

Mylohyoid ridge
is a linear
prominence of bone located on
internal surface of mandible
appearing radiopaque.

Myocardial infarction
is an area of
ischemic necrosis of myocardium
caused by insufficient blood supply
due to coronary artery occlusion.

Myoclonic seizures
are sudden
brief bilaterally synchronus
muscle contractions of face and
trunk without loss of unconsciousness.
Although idiopathic it is
seen in association with uraemia
and hepatic failure.

Myoclonus
is a brief, involuntary
random muscle contractions
occurring with rest in response to
sensory stimuli. It may involve as
single motor unit or group of
units. Sudden brief lapses of
contractions known as negative
myoclonus. Myoclonic jerks may
be focal, segmental or generalized.
Etiogically myoclonus can
be classified as physiologic
myoclonus, essential myoclonus,
epileptic myoclonus and symptomatic
myoclonus.

Myoepithelioma
is an uncommon
salivary gland tumor. Parotid
gland is mostly involved and
palate is the common intraoral
site to be involving tumor has to
be removed surgically.

Myofacial pain
comes from
muscles and surrounding soft
tissues. Injury or overuse results
in painful muscle spasm and may
last long after an injury or muscle
overuse. Muscles become short
and tender. Pressing trigger point
causes increased pain. Physical
therapy and stretching exercises
help.

Myofunctional appliance
is defined
as loose fitting or passive
appliance, which harness natural
forces of the oro-facial musculature
transmitted to the teeth and
alveolar medium through the
medium of the appliance.

Myopathy
is any disease or
abnormal condition of muscle
tissue.

Myosin
is an actin accessory
protein that functions as a
molecular motor. There are
several isoforms of myosin, and
muscle and non-muscle forms
have slightly divergent amino
acid sequences. It is composed of
two heavy chains and four light
chains.

Myositis ossificans
is the
formation of bone within a
muscle which is contused.

Myotonic appliances
are functional
appliances that depend
on the muscle mass for their
action.

Myxoma
resembles primitive mesenchyme
and is true neoplasm.
Oral submucosal area, salivary
gland and jaw bones are commonly
affected. It is a slow growing
invasive tumour that sometime
reaches large dimensions.
Jaw is distended. X-ray will
shows a soap bubble appearance.
Being locally aggressive radical
surgery is advised.

N is the Nasion the
most anterior point of
the nasofrontal suture
in the median plane.
(On radiograph) and
clinically. N’ is the soft
tissue nasion the point
of greatest concavity
in the midline between
the forehead and the nose.

Nails
are thin plates of stratified
squamous epithelial cells. It
contains a very hard form of
keratin. These are found on the
distal ends of fingers and toes. It
has free edge, nail body and nail
root. Extent of nail growth is
represented by half moon shaped
lanula.

Nalgonda technique
(named after
the village in India where the
method is pioneered)
is a
deflouridation technique based
on chemical reaction where raw
water is mixed with adequate
lime and alum. The amount of
lime depends upon the alkanity
of the raw water. If the raw water
has adequate alkalinity the lime
addition is not required. Alum
solution is added after the
addition of lime stirred gently for
10 minutes and the flocs formed
N are allowed to settle. This process
of floc formation and setting
requires an hour.

Nance method
is similar to the
Tweeds technique and involves
the extraction of the deciduous
first molar followed by the
extraction of the first premolars
and the deciduous canine.

Napkin holder
is a standard item
available in different styles used
to secure a dental napkin around
a patient’s neck.

Narcolepsy sleep
may occur in
inappropriate situations during
conversation or meals. There
develops a rapid sleep of poor
quality. One develops hallucinations
and sleep paralysis.

Nasal glioma
is tumor like lesion
in nose in children. It presents as
a rounded projection in the nose.
Microscopically it is made up
mature glial tissue.

Nasal polyp
may be unilateral or
bilateral and can be divided into
non allergic and allergic. Non
allergic polyps consist of an
edematous fibrous stroma.
Variable infiltrate of lymphocytes,
plasma cells and neutrophils are
seen.

Nasal reflex
is the stimulation of the
face or nasal cavity with water or
local irritants, produces apnea
(stops breathing) in neonates –
this leads to bradycardia and
lowering of the cardiac output.

Nasofacial angle
is formed by the
intersection of a line drawn from
glabella to soft-tissue pogonion
with a line drawn along the axis
of the radix of the nose. Average
values are 30 to 35°.

Nasolabial angle
is formed by the
intersection of a columella
tangent and an upper lip tangent.
Normal ranges from 90 – 110°.

Nasomental angle
is constructed by
a line drawn along the axis of the
radix and a line drawn from the
tip of the nose to soft tissue
pogonion (e-line) normal=120-132.

Nasopalatine nerve
is the nerve
which leaves the pterygopalatine
ganglion and passes forward and
downward entering the oral
cavity through incisive foramen.
It provides sensory innervations
to the bone and lingual soft tissues
in the premaxilla.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma symptoms
include pain,
restricted movements of jaw and
ear complaints. There may be
nasal stiffness, nosebleed and
neck mass. Treatment requires
radiation along with chemotherapy.

Nasopharynx
lies behind the nasal
cavities and in the widest part of
pharynx. During swallowing, the
nasopharynx is closed below by
the soft palate and at other times
it is of free communication with
oropharynx. Ostia of auditory
tubes are in lateral walls.

Natural markers
are the persistence
of certain developmental features
of bone, which are used as natural
markers. Trabaculae, nutrient
canals and line of arrested growth
can be used for reference to study
deposition, resorption and
remodelling.

Nd: YAG lasers
as a solid active
medium, a crystal of yttrium –
aluminium – garnet doped with
neodymium. Fiberoptically
delivered in a free running pulsed
mode, most often in contact with
the tissue. First laser designed
exclusively for dentistry.
Emission wavelength is 1064 nm.
Highly absorbed by pigmented
tissue and is about 10,000 times
more absorbed by water than an
Argon laser. Common clinical
applications are for cutting and
coagulation of dental soft tissues
with good hemostatic capability.

Neck-tongue syndrome
is
characterized by unilateral upper
nuchal or occipital pain with or
without numbness in these areas.
There is simultaneous numbness
of tongue on the same side.

Necrosis
means the tissue death
within the living.

Necrotic pulp
refers to the dead or
devitalized tooth. There are no
true symptoms of complete pulp
necrosis for the simple reason that
pulp is destroyed along with its
sensory nerves. Many cases of
pulp necrosis are discovered
because of discoloration of crown.
This applies primarily to anterior
teeth. The radiography may be
helpful if a periapical lesion exists
for its presence and usually
indicates associated pulp death.
On radiograph necrotic pulp may
exhibit only slight periapical
change. The tooth with a necrotic
pulp may also be slightly painful
to percussion.

Necrotic tissue
is a non living
tissue.

Necrotizing sialometaplasia
is a
benign inflammatory reaction of
salivary gland tissue with
unknown etiology. Acinar
necrosis is fairly typical of
coagulation. It develops due to
infarction of tissues fourth decade
of life is mostly affected. Lesion
generally presents as an ulcer.
Most cases occur in palate. It is a
painful lesion; mucus secreting
glands produces ulceration with
rolled borders. Ulcers measures
2-3 cm in diameter. At the base a
few grey granular lobules are
present. Some patients may
complaint of numbness or a
burning type pain in that area.
Biopsy will not show any sign of
malignancy. Debridement will
serve the purpose and the lesions
will heal automatically within 1-2
months. There are no chances of
recurrence.

Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG)
is an inflammatory
destructive disease of the gingiva.
NUG mostly occurs as an acute
condition but mostly undergoes
a diminution in severity, leading
to a subacute stage. It is generally
of sudden onset, clinically it
appears as punched out lesions,
with a crater like depressions
involving the papillary gingiva
which subsequently involves the
marginal gingiva as well, and
spontaneous bleeding on slightest
provocation is also noted. The
lesion is extremely sensitive and
patient may complain of pain
which gets intensified on eating
spicy food. Patient also complains
of metallic foul taste and oral
malodour.

Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP)
is considered to be an
extension of necrotizing ulcerative
gingivitis in to the periodontal
structures leading to
attachment and bone loss. The
clinical pictures of NUP includes
necrosis and ulceration of
interdental papilla, gingiva
appears erythematous, presence
of oral malodour in addition to
fever, malaise and lymphadenopathy.
Stress, smoking and poor
dietary nutrition are considered
to be the main causative factors.

Needle holders
are instruments
which are beneficial during the
suturing of flap or the tissue at the
desired position.

Negative reinforcement
involves
removal of unpleasant stimulus
following a response, e.g., if the
parent gives into the temper
tantrums thrown by the child, he
reinforces this behavior.

Neonatal palatal cyst
appear as
small, white, raised nodules. Size
may go up to 2 to 3 mm in
diameter. These are true cysts
lined by stratified squamous
epithelium. They heal automatically
and don’t require treatment.

Neonatal seizures
occur in first
4 months of life. These may be
focal or multifocal, clonic or focal
tonic or generalized myoclonic.

Neoplasia
is an abnormal mass of
tissue, the growth of which
exceeds and is uncoordinated
with that of normal tissues.
Neoplasia means the process of
new growth. Neoplasm’s which
progress and results in death of
organisms are termed cancerous.
Not all neoplasms are malignant.
Those with a favorable clinical
course and complete recovery are
termed benign neoplasm.

Neoplasm
is uncontrolled growths
due to irregular growth of its
cells. The new growth comprised
of abnormal collection of cells, the
growth of which exceeds and is
irregular A malignant tumor
arising from epithelial tissue is
known as carcinoma, from gland
is known as adenoma, from
cartilaginous tumor it is called as
‘chondroma’.

Nephroblastoma
is an embryonic
tumor derived from primitive
renal epithelial and mesenchymal
components. Abdominal mass is
the commonest complaint with
hematuria and hypertension.
Tumor is single, large circumscribed
mass is firm usually solid.
Tumor may become huge
500-2500 grams.

Nerve block
is a procedure done to
block the nerve conduction by
administration of local anesthetic
agent. It is a one where several
teeth in one quadrant or where
local infiltration is not workable/
useful. Nerve block is done in soft
tissue before it enters the jaw to
reach the teeth. Pain sensations
from every part supplied by
nerve are blocked. Inferior dental
block is commonly done.

Nerve impulse
is a signal that carry
information along the nerves.

Nerve
is a composite of multiple
neurons, where as neuron is a
single nerve cell. Nerve contains
many fibers bundled together
with blood vessels and wrapped
in connective tissue. Nerves are
located outside the CNS.

Nerve root compression
occurs
when nerves which transmit pain
impulses are compressed in
spinal cord/roots, one feels
unpleasant, burning pain often
accompanied by painful sensations.
Some features are due to
direct nerve irritation and others
are due to ischemia. Pain due to
compression of peripheral nerve
is referred to skin from which it
receives sensory fibres. Root pain
radiates throughout the dermatome
of root concerned.

Nerve supply of lower teeth
Branches of mandibular nerve
supply lower teeth.

Neuralgia trigeminal
is a condition
where pain is associated with
trigeminal nerve. Pain generally
affects one side of face around
eye, over cheek or into jaw and
teeth. Pain is excruciating and is
triggered by touching a specific
area of the face, talk or chew the
food.

sessile or pedunculated, elevated
nodules of variable size are
scattered. In second form deeper,
more diffuse lesions of greater
proportions are developed
known as ‘elephantiasis neuromatosa’.

20 cigarette smoker inhales 100
mg of nicotine a week which in a
single dose will kill the person as
quickly as bullet.

Non-specific plaque hypothesis
was given by Walter Loesche in
1976 was given by according to
this hypothesis, periodontal
disease results from the
elaboration of noxious products
by the entire plaque flora. When
only small amount of plaque are
present, the noxious products are
neutralized by the host.

to result from an accumulation of
plaque over time in conjunction
with a decrease host response and
increase host susceptibility of age.
All plaque was thought to be alike
and equally capable of causing
disease.

forming odontoblasts. Actually it
is composed of the cell bodies of
odontoblasts along with
capillaries, nerve fibres and
dendritic cells. In the coronal
portion of a young pulp the
odontoblasts assume a tall
columnar form. The tight packing
together of these tall, slender cells
produces the appearance of a
palisade. The odontoblasts vary in
height; consequently their nuclei
are not at the same level.

that young boys have a natural
tendency to be attached to the
mother and they consider their
father as enemy. Hence they
strive to imitate their father to
gain the affection of the mother.
Freud also described oedipal
complex as a desire to have sexual
relation with the mother. Name
oedipal complex is derived from
Greek mythology. Oedipus is
king, unwittingly slew his father
and married his mother. The little
boy adopts his father’s manners,
attitude, thinking that by

in which the distal segment of the
extremity does not bear weight.

Operant conditioning
is significant
extension of classical conditionings.
Individual response is
changed as result of
reinforcement or extinction of
previous responses. Hence
satisfactory outcome will be
repeated while unsatisfactory
outcomes will diminish
infrequency. According to this
theory, the consequence of
behavior itself acts as a stimulus
and affects future behavior. Since
the behavior acts upon the
environment called operant.
Skinner described four basic
types of operant conditioning
distinguished by the type of
consequence.

an index developed by Marcus M.,
Koch A.L. and Gershen, J.A. in
1980. This index measure included
the three components of the dmft
(decayed, missing and filled teeth)
and 15 other variable such as
temporomandibular dysfunction,
degree of periodontal disease and
tumors. To calculate this measure
for a population, a prior planning
is needed to develop an
examination protocol that includes
all appropriate measurements. In
a modified oral health index,
“Marcus, Koch and Gershen”
(1983, 1985 used weights for bone
loss, missing free ends and
decayed/fractured and replaced
teeth. This modified index is easier
to use in epidemiological setting
but its various components still
need to be part of the planned
protocol.

Oral herpangina
is characterized
by sore throat, dysphagia, and
stiff neck with loss of appetite.
There develops small papulovesicular
lesions about 1-2 mm in
diameter with a grayish surface
surrounded by red areola in palate.
Disease lasts for 4-5 days.

Oral hygiene
consists of keeping
the teeth clean and free of food
debris. It prevents accumulation
and persistence of plaque which
leads to dental disease. Tooth
brush is an effective tool. Eating
raw, firm and fibrous food/fruits
as apples, pears and carrots also
help to clean the teeth.

Oral hygiene index
given by John
C. Greene and Jack R. Vermillian
introduced the oral hygiene index,
while they were developing
a plan to study variations in gingival
inflammation in relation to
the degree of mental retardation
in children, as it became apparent
that it would be necessary to
separate out the effects of variations
in oral cleanliness. In 1960,
the “oral hygiene index” (OHI)
was introduced a “sensitive,
simple method for assessing
group or individual oral hygiene
quantitatively”. The oral hygiene
index requires the user to make
more decisions and to spend
more time in arriving the result.
Therefore, an effort was made to
develop another equally sensitive
index which would reduce both
the number of decisions and time
required. This index was named
the “simplified oral hygiene index”
(OHI -S). The OHI and OHIS
were developed primarily to
serve as systematic approaches to
quantitating the oral cleanliness
variable in population studies.

Oral indices
(George P. Barnes et
al) are essentially sets of values,
usually numerical with maximum
and minimum limits, used
to describe variables of specific
conditions on a graduated scale,
which use the same criteria and
method to compare a specific
variable in individuals, samples
or populations with that same
variable as is found in other individuals,
samples or populations.

induces both Humoral and
intestinal immunity. It is cheaper
and effective. It should not be
given in acute infection.

Oral screen
is a functional appliance
that produces effect by redirecting
the pressure of the muscular
and soft tissue curtain of the
cheeks and lips. It is also used to
counteract deficiencies in lip posture

frequently on anteriors than
compared to posterior covering
both facial and lingual surfaces of
anterior teeth. These stains are
generally caused by chromogenic
bacteria.

is any device which when
in contact with the body improves
the function of that part.

Orthostatic hypotension
is a
common cause of vasomotor
syncope especially in elderly,
diabetics or autonomic neuropathy.
A greater than normal
decline of 20 m.m. Hg in blood
pressure is seen immediately
upon arising from supine to
standing position.

Orthostatic syncope
occurs within
seconds or minutes of assuming
upright posture. Patients are
vulnerable on rising and after
meals. It differs from vasovagal
syncope in that skin may be
warm, pulse rate unchanged and
sweating absent.

Osseointegration
is a direct
structural and functional connection
between ordered, living bone
and the surface of a load carrying
implant or it can also be described
as relationship between endosseous
implants and bone where
the bone is in intimate contact with
implant but no ultrastructural
contact is seen between the two.

Osseous craters
are the concavities
in the crest of the interdental bone
confined within the facial and the
lingual walls.

Osseous pains
are due to infection
or injury. Such pains are more
stable than myogenous pain.
Acute septic osteitic usually is
designated osteomyelitis. Pain is
of throbbing quality. It induces
necrosis by pressure against the
unyielding walls. When cortex is
penetrated pain intensity
decreases. When confinement is
released by rupture or surgical
drainage pain intensity drops
fast.

Ossifying fibroma
are frequently
found in paranasal sinuses
especially antrum. These produce
large densely calcified masses.

Osteoarthritis
is an old age
degenerative joint disease
without systemic manifestation.
Disease may be primary in
interphalangeal joins. Secondary
may be post traumatic. Bones
X-ray may show subchondral
sclerosis, cortical buttressing,
trabecular hypertrophy,
osteophyte, cysts and collapse.
Erosive osteoarthritis occurs in
menopausal women. Pain is
worse on activity and is relieved
on rest.

Osteoblasts
are bone forming cells
located on bone surfaces and
helps in the growth and development
of teeth and bones.

Osteochondroma
is a bony
exostosis projecting from external
surface of bone having a hyaline
lined cartilaginous cap. These are
found in childhood and are
asymptomatic. There develops
hard, painless mass near a joint of
a long tubular bone. Cartilaginous
cap shows irregularity
and spotty calcifications. These
projects away from joint. When
cap becomes more than 2 cm
malignant transformation may
take place.

Osteoclastoma
are brown tumors
visible as distinct geographic
radiolucencies. These are central,
slightly expansile and septated
looking like a destructive
neoplasm. Mandible is mostly
involved. These are markers of
primary hyperparathyroidism.
MRI may show fluid – fluid level.

Osteoclasts are bone removing
multinucleated cells which help
remodel bone.

Osteoconduction
is the formation
of bone by osteoblasts occurring
from the margins of the defect on
the bone graft material. These
bone graft material facilitate bone
formation by bridging the gap
between the existing bone and a
distant location which is otherwise
not possible.

Osteocyte
is a mature bone cell
responsible for maintaining bone
tissue.

Osteogenesis imperfecta
is a
serious disease of unknown
etiology. Disease is visual at birth.
Bones are fragile and porous.
Fractures occur while child learns
walking. It develops due to
defective matrix formation and
lack of mineralization. Fetal
collagen is not able to transform
into mature collagen. There are 4
types. Two are autosomal
recessive and rests two are
autosomal dominant type.
Moderate and deforming type –
these are associated with
deciduous teeth and blue sclera.
Child may have abnormal shape
of skull, joint dislocations and
defective heart valve. Mild not
deforming type – patient
otherwise is clinically normal.
Person has blue sclera and
dentinogenesis imperfecta.
Neonatal lethal type – it is a
serious form of disease. There are
multiple fractures of bone. Severe
non lethal type – patient develops
fracture with slight trauma.
Fractures heel early but deformity
remains.

Osteogenic sarcoma
is a primary
malignant tumor of bone. Patient
is young between the age of 10-20
years. Pain and swelling are
presenting features. Long bones
are targets. Alkaline phosphatase
enzyme will be raised. Metastasis
to lung is through hematogenous
route. Periosteal new bone
formation occurs and is highly
irregular. Sun ray appearance is
characteristic. Osteogenic sarcoma
of mandible is also noted.

Osteoid osteoma
is a benign tumor
of bone. It rarely develops after
the age of 30. Pain is severe.
Radiographs will show small
round radiolucent area surrounded
by a rim of sclerotic bone.
Lesion is seldom larger than 1 cm.
It consists of central nidus of
compact osteoid tissue with
calcification. Surgical excision is
the treatment of choice.

Osteoinduction
is a process where
new bone formation occurs
through the stimulation of
osteoprogenitor from the defect
that differentiates into osteoblasts.

Osteoinducutive material
is a
material which causes the
conversion of mesenchymal cells
preferentially to bone progenitor
cells.

Osteoma
is a benign neoplasm.
There is proliferation of cancellous
bone in an endosteal or periosteum.
It is not a common oral
lesion. It shows a circumscribed
swelling on jaw. It is not painful.
Lesion is not capsulated and has
to be removed surgically.

Osteomalacia
is the counterpart of
rickets in adults, commonly seen
in women with pardah and
menopausal females. Skeletal
pain is usually present and
persistent and ranges from
backache to severe pain. Bone
tenderness and muscular
weakness are often present.
Patient may find it difficult to
climb stairs or getting out of chair.
A waddling gait is not unusual.
Osteoporosis which is atrophy of
bone occurs and is due to
defective formation of bone
matrix. Bones becomes soft. X-ray
shows severe asymmetric
deformities of all stress bearing
bones. Histological findings are
non specific. Cortical bone
becomes thin. Bone tenderness
and muscular weakness are often
present.

Osteopetrosis
is a rare hereditary
bone disease. There is lack of
resorption of normal primitive
osteochondrous tissue. Patient
dies early. There may be severe
anemia. Liver and spleen are
enlarged with palpable lymph
glands. Leukemia and sarcoma
are common sequelae. All bones
are of homogeneous increased
density. There may be bones
within a bone. Ilium shows dense
curved lines paralleling to iliac
crest. Skull changes include
calvarial and basilar thickening
and sclerosis.

Osteopoikilosis is characterized by
small, round or ovoid radio
opacities in juxta articular region.
More of males are affected and
are asymptomatic. Lesions are
foci of bone which have failed to
become cancellous. On X-ray
lesions are symmetric of 1 to 8
mm in size these are uniformly
dense.

Osteoporotic compression fracture
can occurs even during coughing
or lifting a bag simply. On X-ray
anterior wedge is most commonly
seen in thoracic vertebra and
biconcave end plate fracture in
lumbar arc. Pain is so severe that
person has to be admitted.
Bracing is important to ambulate
such patients.

Osteosarcoma
is a very common
neoplasm arising from bone.
According to the site tumor has
been divided into periosteal
sarcoma, medullary osteosarcoma
and parosteal
osteosarcoma, soft tissue
osteosarcoma. Maxilla is affected
more than mandible. It s a fast
growing and develops as painful
swelling of jaw, Expansion and
distortion of cortical plates may
takes place. Severe deformity of
face leads to the displacement of
teeth. Overlying skin becomes red
and inflamed. Ulceration,
hemorrhage and pathological
fracture takes place. In osteolytic
type it presents irregular,
radiolucent areas giving rise to a
moth eaten appearance.
Expansion, destruction and
perforation of cortical plates are
noted. Teeth are displaced in
position. Osteosarcoma develops
between the age of 10-15 years.
Males are more affected. Pain and
swelling are early features. It may
produce facile deformity. Teeth
may become loose. It contains
proliferation of atypical
osteoblasts and less differentiated
precursors. Radiograph shows
excessive bone production. In
some, spicules of new bone may
be seen. In jaws, cortical plates
may show sclerosis. Destruction
is also noted.

Osteosclerosis
is a common cause
of deafness and onset is in third
decade. The stapedial foot palate
develops fibrous fixation and the
foot plate is later replaced by
sclerotic bone.

Outcome research
is an analysis of
clinical practice as it actually
occurs for the purpose of
determining effectiveness of
clinical methods by the
researcher.

Over bite
is the amount of vertical
overlap between the maxillary
and mandibular incisors. The
relationship can be described
either in millimeters or more often
as a percentage of how many
upper central incisors over lap the
crowns of the lower incisors. The
overbite in the primary dentition
normally varies between 10% and
40% when the incisor edges of the
incisors are at the same level the
condition is described as edge to
edge or zero overbite.

Over dentures
is a fabricated
removable prosthetic appliance
attached to the abutment
cylinders. It is the one which is
fitted on top of standing teeth or
retained roots. Advantage of it is
the presence of natural roots
remaining in alveolar bone. As
long as any roots remain there
hardly any loss of alveolar bone
takes place. Where there are no
remaining roots implants can be
used to support an over denture.

Over infusion
is over transfusion
may be of blood or saline.
Respiration becomes shallow and
rapid. Patient feels uncomfortable
in lying supine. Neck veins are
congested. There may be slight
pitting edema. Crepts may be
present on independent parts of
body. Patient may develop
dieresis.

Over jet
is the horizontal
relationship or the distance
between the most protruded
maxillary central incisor and the
opposing mandibular central
incisor. The relationship is
expressed in millimeters. If the
maxillary incisors are lingual to
the mandibular incisors the
relationship is described as an
under jet. The normal range of
over jet in primary dentition
varies between 0 and 4 mm. In the
same study by foster the over jet
was ideal in 28% of the cases and
excessive in 72% of the children.
Again the presence of excessive
over jet was attributed to the
effects of the oral habits.

Over use
is the chronic injury by
repetitive stress.

Oviducts
refer to fallopian tubes.

Oxidation
is a chemical reaction
that occurs when processing
solutions are exposed to air. It is
a chemical breakdown causing
decreased concentration of
solution strength.

Oxidized cellulose
is gauze treated
with nitrogen dioxide. On
moistening the gauze adheres to
the bleeding tissue and readily
produces a clot.

Oxygen
is a molecule composed of
two oxygen molecules. Air we
breathe contains about 21%
oxygen. It is essential for life.
Oxygen we breathe is used by
cells to extract or liberate the
energy from food we eat.

Oxygen therapy
is an administration
of oxygen gas to
individuals suffering from
hypoxia.

Oxyphill adenoma
is a benign
tumor occurring in parotid gland
in elderly age group. It is
composed of polygonal cells with
mitochondria in eosinophilic
granular cytoplasm. Centrally
placed nuclei are uniform, small
and round. Salivary enlargement
is a result of benign epithelial
metaplasia.

Oxytalan fibres
are made up of two
immature forms of elastin,
oxytalan and eluanin. These fibers
run parallel to the root surface in
a vertical direction, bend and
attach themselves to the
cementum in the apical one third
of the tooth.

Pachyonchia congenital
is rare and inherited
as autosomal
dominant characteristic.
It also refers to oral
leukokeratosis as well
as striking nail
changes and develop
shortly after birth.
There is congenital gross thickening
of finger and toe nails as they
become thick and hardened with
brownish material at nail bed.
Corneal dystrophy, thickening of
tympanic membrane and mental
retardation are reported. Dorsum
of tongue becomes thickened and
greyish white. Cheeks may also
be involved on occasion. Hyperkeratotic
calluses of palms and
soles may develop. Oral lesions
include focal or generalized
white, opaque thickening of mucosa.
Angular cheliosis also develop.
Frequent oral aphthous
ulceration may be seen. There is
no treatment available.

Packed RBCs transfusion
helps in
raising hematocrit. Each unit of
300 ml consists of 200 ml of RBCs.
One unit of packed RBCs will
raise the hematocrit by 4%.

Paget’s disease
is a disease of
middle age. Most of patients are
asymptomatic. There will be pain
with multiple fractures. Milkman’s
syndrome are local areas of
demineralization with in the
bone. Pseudo-fractures may also
be seen. Spinal cord and nerve
root compression may be seen.

Pain
is a symptom in completely
subjective sense. It is a complex
experience that includes a sensory
– discriminatory component. Pain
is accompanied by the most
widespread reactions and can
sometimes be said truly to involve
the whole being. The experience
of pain is a subjective, private
sensation, which can be described
only imperfectly to others.
Whereas it is possible to share
other sensations, for example,
listening, testing or touching with
reasonable certainty of the same
experience as another person but
this is not possible with pain. Pain
also includes the reactions elicited
by the stimulus. For instance,
some of the reactions to a noxious
stimulus include pain. Startle
response, muscle reflex, vocalization,
sweating, and increase in
heart rate, in addition to blood
pressure and behavioral changes
takes place. Therefore pain is a
neuroscience characterized by
1.The more sensory nerves that
supply a region of body, the more
acute the sensibility in the area.
2. The higher the ratio of motor
nerves to muscles, the greater the
possible control finesse.

Pain threshold
is that point at
which sufficient pain transmitting
neurochemical reach the brain to
cause discomfort. Pain threshold
is the amount of stimulus which
produces a sensation of pain.

Palatal papillomatosis
is an unusual
condition involving mucosa of the
palate. It develops in edentulous
patient with denture. Lesion
presents with numerous red,
oedematous papillary projections.
It may involve whole of hard
palate. Each papilla is 1 to 2 mm
in diameter. No specific therapy is
available.

Palatal surface
is the surface of the
maxillary teeth nearest the palate.

Palate soft
is the posterior most
portion of roof of mouth separating
the mouth and pharynx.

Palatine tonsils
are paired masses
of lymphoid tissue lying in lateral
wall of pharynx and form part of
Waldeyer’s ring. Reactive
lymphoid hyperplasia can result
in their enlargement. It then
produces difficulty in breathing.

Palladium cobalt alloys
contains
88% palladium and 4 to 5% cobalt
by weight. It has a higher
coefficient of thermal expansion
which is useful with certain
porcelains. Disadvantage is of
formation of dark oxide at
margins.

Palladium copper alloys
were
introduced in 1982. It contains 70
to 80% palladium a little gold,
15% copper and 9% gallium.
There is no change of color
problem. It generally doesn’t melt
easily so casting becomes
difficult.

Palladium-silver alloy
usually
include 50 to 60% palladium with
most of the balance being silver.
It has good corrosion resistance.
The disadvantage is that color
changes to green.

Palliative
refers to relief of pain but
not a cure.

Pallor usually indicates anemia but
may be a sign of low cardiac
output.
Palm down rest
are the type of
extraoral rest which can be
established by resting the front
surfaces of the middle and fourth
finger on the skin overlying the
lateral aspect of the mandible on
the left side of the face.

Palm up rest
are the type of extraoral
rest which can be established
by resting the back of the middle
and fourth finger on the skin
overlying the lateral aspect of the
mandible on the right side of the
face.

Palmer’s notation
is an
identification system for teeth;
widely used to designate
individual teeth amongst
orthodontists. Each of the four
quadrants is given its own tooth
bracket made up of a vertical line
and a horizontal line. This system
is a shorthand diagram of the
teeth as if the patient’s teeth were
being viewed from the outside.
The teeth in the right quadrant
would have the vertical midline
bracket to the right of the tooth
numbers or letters, just as when
looking at the patient-the midline
is to the right of the teeth in the
right quadrant.

Palpate
is to examine and explore
by touching.

Panic disorder
many patients with
panic disorder have existing
symptoms of depression with
suicidal tendency. Person will
develop chest pain, dyspnea, and
palpitation. Sweating and
trembling develops. Person
develops fear of dying.

Panophthalmitis
is a condition
where there is development of
intense pain, fever, malaise and
complete loss of vision. Lids are
oedematous. There is chemosis of
conjunctiva. Person develops
proptosis and limitation of eye
movements. Anterior chamber is
full of pus.

Panoramic radiographs
are an
X-ray film to obtain the wide view
of upper and lower jaw and their
associated structures. These are
useful for viewing larger areas of
maxilla or mandible on single
film. These don’t give minor
details such as to detect interproximal
bone loss or other fine
changes.

Panorex
refers to panaromic radiographs.
Pantothenic acid was discovered in
the year 1940. This vitamin is
widely distributed in animals and
vegetable foods. No specific
deficiency. This vitamin losses
15-50%, on heating drying and
cooking. Milling of wheat causes
50% loss of it.

Papillary gingivitis
involves the
inflammation of papillary gingiva
and often extends into the
adjacent portion of the gingival
margin.

Papilloma
is a common benign
neoplasm arising from epithelial
tissue. There develops an
exophytic papillary growth of
stratified squamous epithelium.
They appear as a small finger like
projections giving a cauliflower
like shape of surface squamous
epithelium and may be caused by
human papilloma virus (HPV-6,
HPV-11). It is a slow growing,
small, painless. Size varies from
a few mm. to 1 cm. It is pedunculated,
ovoid swelling white in
color. Multiple papilloma of oral
cavity is known as papillomatosis.
It is not a premalignant condition
surgical excision along with base
is advised. Recurrence is very
rarely seen.

Papilloma of tongue
is an
exophytic growth where patient
present with a warty swelling of
tongue of long duration. Mostly
it is present on dorsum of tongue.
It is pedunculated, mobile and
soft in touch.

Papilloma of ureters
may be single
or multiple, small, papillary and
branching pattern. Mitosis is
absent and basal polarity is
retained. These can recur.

Papillon-lefevre syndrome
is
characterized by hyperkeratotic
skin lesion, severe periodontal
destruction and calcification of
the dura, the cutaneous and the
dural changes generally occurs
before the age of 4 years.
Premature loss of primary and
permanent dentitions and ectopic
calcifications, the syndrome is
inherited and appears to follow
an autosomal recessive pattern.
Parents are not affected and may
occur in siblings; males and
females are equally affected. The
syndrome is an autosomal
recessive trait with a prevalence
of about 1-4 per million of the
population Rapid and progressive
periodontal destruction
affects the primary dentition with
an onset at about 2 years.
Exfoliation of all primary teeth is
usually before the permanent
successors erupt and patients
may be mid to late teens.

Para amino salicylic acid
is an
antimetabolite of the tuberculosis
bacteria. It has a weak effect.

Paracetamol
is an NSAID and is
more widely used as anti pyretic
and anti analgesic drug.
Phenacetin has a disadvantage of
creating papillary necrosis and
methhemoglobinemia. Paracetamol
also may produce fatal
hepatic necrosis. It has very
minimal anti-inflammatory effect.
One gram daily is a safer dose.

Parachute reflex
appears about 6-9 months. This reflex is elicited by
lowering the newborn in ventral
suspension for a short distance.
Normal reflex includes extension
of arms, limbs and fingers. In
children with cerebral palsy, the
reflex may be absent or abnormal
(see Figure on page 344).

Paraffin Wax
Wax bath are
available in many sizes. The
melted wax needs to be
maintained at temperature
40 to 44° C. It is the most
convenient way of applying
conducted heat to the extremities.
Wax gives off heat slowly due to
its low thermal conductivity. It
has a sedative effect on the
sensory nerve endings.

Parahemophilia
is a rare
hemorrhagic disorder. It is
inherited as an autosomal
recessive trait. Excessive epistaxis
and menorrhagia is common.
Intraocular hemorrhage or
hemorrhage into CNS has been
reported. Spontaneous gingival
bleeding occurs with no specific
treatment available.

Paramyxovirus
are large pleomorphic
enveloped RNA viruses.
These are responsible for measles,
mumps para influenza and
respiratory pneumonitis and
bronchiolitis.

Parasitic theory
was described in
1843 by Erdl described filamentous
parasites in the “surface
membrane” of teeth. Shortly
thereafter Ficinus, a Dresden
physician observed filamentous
microorganisms, which he called
denticulate in material taken from
carious activities. He implied that
these bacteria caused decomposition
of the enamel and then
the dentin. Neither Erdl nor
Ficinus explained how these
organisms destroyed tooth
structure.

Paraviruses
are icosahedral viruses
with single stranded DNA.

Parching
is a process of puffing
wheat, rice and maize. Material is
suddenly heated. Water escapes
by puffing out the grain.
Murmure and popcorn are well
known parched products. This
way starch becomes more
digestible.

Parkinsonism
is a clinical
syndrome of bradykinesia,
rigidity, tremor at rest and loss of
postural reflexes. Bradykinesia is
the diagnostic feature. There is
difficulty in initiating voluntary
movement. Expression is staring
with drooling of saliva,
hypophonia, micrographia. Gait
is short and suffling with lack of
arm swing. Patient is unable to
perform rapid, repetitive
movement. It is difficult for him
to change posture in bed or rise
from a chair. Tendon reflexes are
normal.

Parotid gland
is the largest of the
three paired salivary gland. It is a
bilobular serous gland overlying
the masseter muscle. It extends
upward to the level of the
auditory canal and downward to
the lower border of the mandible.
Posteriorly it overlaps the
sternomastoid muscles and
anteriorly extends into the buccal
pad of fat where it gives off its
excretory duct. The salivary
secretions are serous in nature
and discharged into the oral
cavity via the Stensen’s duct.
This duct emerges part from the
anterior aspect of the gland
crosses the masseter, pierces the
buccinator muscle and opens in
the vestibule of mouth opposite
to the first molar tooth. The duct
is about 5 cm long and 3 mm
internal diameter.

Partial anodontia/Hypodontia
is
the congenital absence of one or
more teeth. Many cases of hypodontia
appear to be genetically
controlled. Environment also
influences the final outcome or in
some cases may be responsible
completely for the lack of tooth
formation. For example trauma,
infection, radiation, chemotherapy,
endocrine disturbances
and severe intrauterine disturbances
have been associated with
missing teeth.

Partial seizures
are simple seizure,
contraction of muscles in one part
of body without loss of
consciousness. Each contraction is
caused by discharge of neurons in
contralateral motor cortex when
neuronal discharge is from
sensory cortex. Paresthesias
hallucinations and psychic
symptoms appear. Partial seizures
involve a specific region of the
brain. Focal seizures remain
localized, in which paroxysmal
neuronal activity is limited to one
part of cerebrum. The individual’s
consciousness and awareness
usually is somewhat disturbed
and variable degree of amnesia
may be evident. Partial seizures
have highest incidence of a
detectable cortical lesion. Focal
seizure can turn into a generalized
seizure in which case individual
looses consciousness. Generalized
seizures are clinically more
dangerous in the dental office due
to their greater potential for injury
and post seizure complication.

Partial thickness flap
refers to the
flap that includes only the layer
of epithelium and a layer of
underlying connective tissue. The
bone remains covered by the
layer of connective tissue including
the periosteum. Also known
as split thickness/mucosal flap.

Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
measures the effectiveness of clot
formation. This test is performed
measuring the time it takes for a
clot to form after the addition of
a Kaolin, a surface activating
factor and a cephalin a substitute
platelet factor to plasma. Normal
PTT is 25-40 seconds. Greater than
50 seconds may cause severe
bleeding. It is used to monitor
heparin therapy.

Pascal
is a metric unit of pressure.
1 MPa (megapascal) is = 1 MN/m2.

Passive eruption
describes the
process by which teeth continue
to erupt into the mouth as tooth
structure is lost to attrition and
wear.

Passive immunity
is the one where
the antibodies produced another
person is used to protect against
infectious disease. It can be natural
or acquired. Natural passive
immunity develops when
antibodies from a mother passes
through the placenta to the
developing fetus. These antibodies
protect a child till his immune
system matures. While passive
immunity can be acquired
through an injection of antibodies
against a micro-organism to which
person has not developed
antibodies. This type of immunity
is short lived but acts immediately.

Passive modalities
are therapeutic
techniques that don’t require the
patient’s active participation.

Paste
is a vehicle that contains a
drug.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
is a
congenital heart disease. There are
no symptoms unless left
ventricular failure or pulmonary
hypertension develops. Heart may
be slightly enlarged. Pulse
pressure is wide and diastolic
pressure is low. Continuous rough
machinery murmur accentuated
in late systole at the time of S2 is
heard at left first and second
interspace. Thrills are common.

Pathogen
refers to a microorganism
capable of causing disease.

Pathologic grief
is the condition in
which a person cannot tolerate a
grief.

Pathological fractures
are the
fractures resulting due to
underlying pathology and not
due to any type of trauma e.g.
fracture occurring due to
osteomyelitis.

Pathological tooth migration
refers
to the tooth displacement that
occurs due to imbalance among
the factors that maintain physiologic
tooth position is disturbed
by the periodontal disease.

Pathology
is the study of abnormal
(diseased) tissue conditions.

Pathosis
refers to disease entity.

Pattern theory
replaced the
summation theory where by the
pattern of neural impulses set up
by the noxious stimuli were
considered important.

Pattern Growth pattern
is a set of
constraints operating to preserve
the integration of parts under
varying conditions or through
time. The interaction throughout
the life between hereditary and
environment determines the
expression of patterns. The two
aspects of normal growth pattern
are: cephalocaudal gradient of
growth and Scammon’s growth
curve.

Peak aerobic power
is the maximum
power output or peak
oxygen intake that a person can
attain safely when performing a
large muscle activity as on
treadmill.
Pediatric dentistry (AAPD-1985)
also known as pedodontics and as
dentistry for adolescents and
children is the area of dentistry
concerned with preventive and
therapeutic oral health care for
children from birth through
adolescent. It also includes special
care for special patients beyond
the age of adolescent who
demonstrate mental, physical and
emotional problems.

Pediatric dentistry (AAPD-1999)
is
an age defined speciality that
provides both primary and
comprehensive preventive and
therapeutic oral health care for
infants and children through
adolescence, including those with
special health care needs.

Pediatric dentistry
is concerned
with the preventive and therapeutic
oral healthcare of children
from birth to adolescence.

Pediatrics
is related to child.

Pedicle graft
is the graft that
remains attached to its donor site.

Pellagra
is a nutritional disease
occurring due to the deficiency of
niacin, among poor pesant fed on
maize. Greater part of niacin in
maize is not available. More over
principal protein of maize, zein is
deficient in essential amino acid
tryptophan, the alternative source
of niacin. It may develop 6-8
weeks of deficiency of niacin. Pellagra
has been called the disease
of three D’s dermatitis, diarrhea
and dementia.

Pellicle
is a thin deposit which may
form shortly after eruption on the
exposed surface of teeth, i.e. it is
the first step in plaque formation;
a clear, thin covering containing
proteins and lipids (fats) found in
saliva It is fully formed in 30
minutes and reaches its mature
thickness of 0.1 to 0.6 microns
within a day. It is free of bacteria.
Brown pigment is due to presence
of tannins in the pellicle.
Acquired pellicles are composed
of mucoprotenis containing lipid
material.

Pemphigoid
is the term that
generally refers to the number of
cutaneous, immune – mediated,
subepithelial bullous diseases that
are characterized by the separation
of basement membrane.

Pemphigus erythematosus
is a
condition where there is
occurrence of bullae and vesicles
concomittent with the appearance
of crusted patches. There may be
fever and malaise. Even death
may occur.

Pemphigus foliaceus
is early
bullous lesions rapidly ruptures
and leaves masses of flakes or
scales.

Pemphigus
is a serious chronic skin
disease with vesicle and bullae of
different sizes. Etiology is still unknown.
It is of many types such
as pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus
vegetans, pemphigus
foliciceus and pemphigus erythematosus
(see Figure on page 348).

Pemphigus Vegetans
is a benign
variant of pemphigus vulgaris.
The fungoid masses are covered
by purulent exudates. It shows
inflamed border. It is of 2 types.
Neumann type is more common.
Early lesions presents as large
with denuded areas, while
Hallopeau type is less aggressive
and appear as pustules in the initial
stage. These are followed by
verrucous, hyperkeratotic vegetations.
Gingival lesions appear as
lace like ulcers. Base is of granular/
cobblestone appearance.

Pemphigus Vulgaris
is an auto
immune disease. It is
characterized by rapid
appearance of vesicles and bullae.
These lesions contain a thin
watery fluid. Classically lesion
may appear as a thin walled bulla
arising from mucosa. Bulla breaks
rapidly and continues to extend
peripherally. Pressure to an
apparently normal surface will
result in formation of a new
lesion. On breaking of bullae,
ulcers may appear shallow. A thin
layer of epithelium peels away in
an irregular manner leaving the
denuded base. Edges of lesions
continue to extend.

Penetration coefficient
is the
combination of properties of
viscosity, surface tension and
contact angle which promotes
rapid capillary penetration.

Penicillin
is an antibiotic that
contains a beta - lactam ring and
inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan
cross-links in bacterial cell
walls (especially in Gram-positive
organisms). This weakens the cell
wall and water enters the cell by
osmosis, causing cells to burst.
Penicillin is bactericidal but can
act only on dividing cells and is
not toxic to animal cells, which
have no cell wall.

PENS
stands for percutaneous
electric nerve stimulation. It is a
pain management technique
involving a combination of
acupuncture needles and transcutaneous
nerve stimulation.

drug with no potential abuse. It
produces CNS analgesia, sedation
and respiratory depression.
Euphoria is not much. Some may
feel nightmares and hallucinations.
30 mg I.V. of it is effective
as 10 mg of morphine. It is more
potent than morphine. It causes
addiction.

Penthane
is halogenated either and
was synthesized liquid. It is kept
in opaque bottles to retard
decomposition. It has a fruity
odour. It is neither explosive nor

and anxiety prone personalities
are more prone to it. Emotional
stress, disprins and other pain
killers may cause it.

Perforated ulcer
may be caused by
non steroidal anti-inflammatory

process of dental periapical
region. It may also develop due
to traumatic injury. Tooth is
extruded and becomes painful.

periodontal ligament around the
apex of tooth and usually in a
mandibular incisor area. It is
discovered accidently during
routine X-ray.

Periapical granuloma
is a lesion, a
localized mass of granulation
tissue around the apex of a non
vital tooth appears radiolucent. It
is the most common squel of

symptom. Pain increases in
supine posture and is reduced in
sitting posture. Person will
develop dyspnea, fever, fatigue,
abdominal pain and syncope.
Pericardial rub is best heard over
the left sternal border and is
increased by sitting up and
leaning forward. Healing
produces fibrosis and adhesion
between two layers.

Pericoronitis
generally refers to
inflammation of the gingiva in
relation to the crown of an
unerupted tooth. It generally
occurs in a partially erupted or
impacted third molar. The space
present between the overlying
flap and the erupting tooth
provides an excellent environment
for the accumulation of food
debris and nurturing of oral
microorganisms which leads to
infection and ultimately inflammation.
The patient may have
erythematous, edematous and
suppurative type of lesion that is
quite sensitive to pain along with
radiating pain to nearby areas.
There might be some amount of
swelling at the angle of the mouth
along with local lymphadenopathy
of the affected side.

year as well as those cases arising
during the year.

Periodontal abscess
is a localized
purulent infection within the
tissue adjacent to the periodontal
pocket that may lead to

as a simple marginal gingivitis as
a reaction to calculus or plaque.
There will be tiny ulceration of
crevicular epithelium. Gingiva
becomes more inflamed and
swollen. Calculus may be present.
Gingiva bleeds easily. Foul
halitosis may be present. Teeth
become mobile and dull on
percussion. X-ray will show
blunting of alveolar crest. If there
is no excessive bone loss, the tooth
can be saved.

Periodontium
is the structure that
surrounds and supports the teeth.
Periodontium attaches the tooth
to its bony housing. These are
tissues that invest and support the
teeth such as gingiva and alveolar
bone. It provides resistance to
forces of mastication, speech and
deglutition. It defends against
external noxious stimuli.

Periodontoblastic space
is a fluidfilled
space located between the
dentinal tubule and the cell-wall
of the cytoplasmic part of the
odontoblastic process. This
interstitial fluid continues beyond
the cytoplasmic part of the process
and extends the full length of the
tubule, surrounding remnants of
the odontoblastic processes found
in peripheral circumpulpal dentin.
It plays an important role when
tissue changes occur within the
primary dentin.

cells which has the potential to
develop in to osteoblasts and an
outer layer which is rich in blood
vessels and nerves.

Periotemp probe

of diagnostic probe that helps in
detecting early inflammatory
changes in the gingiva by detecting
temperature rise. The probe
detects pocket temperature difference
of 0.1 degrees from the reference
subgingival temperature.

is a
complication mostly occurring in
diabetes. Neuron is the term for
nerve. Nerves that go to your
arms, legs, hands, feet are called
peripheral nerves. Pathos means
suffering. Many diseases diabetes,
thyroid, rheumatoid and kidney
disease can cause damage to
peripheral nerves. Damage causes
tingling, numbness, burning and
pain. There are no medicines to
improve the nerve function in
peripheral neuropathy. Aerobic
exercises can reduce the
unpleasant feeling.

morphine. Its primary action is on
central nervais system and
smooth muscle. Somatic and
visceral pain is relieved together.
It has anticholinergic properties
also hence it is used for visceral
pain also. Analgesia is achieved
in 15 minutes after intake and
lasts for 5 hours. 100 mg of
pethidine analgesia is equivalent
to 10 mg of morphine. It may
produce drug abuse and

seconds. Person quickly regains
his consciousness. Incidence
decreases with age and seldom
seen beyond 30 years of age.

episode. EEG shows symmetrical
3 Hz spike and wave discharge
throughout the brain during
attack.

Petrovic’s hypothesis (Servo system)
explains the primary
cartilage in which growth occurs
by differentiation of chondroblasts.
It can be modified with
factors which effect the direction
only and not the amount of
growth. Secondary cartilage has
a direct cell multiplication effect
but more importantly indirect
affects also a play important role.
e.g. it explains the mode of action
of the functional appliances
directed at the condyle and the
upper arch acts as a mould into
which the lower arch adjusts itself
in such a way that optimal
occlusion is established.

which has three serotypes 1.2 and
3. Most out breaks are due to type
I virus. In a cold environment
virus can survive for 4 months,
faeces for 6 months. Cases are
most infectious 7 to 10 days before
and after onset of symptoms.
Incubation period is 7-14 days. In
paralytic polio of 1% cases virus
invades CNS and causes varying
degrees of asymmetrical flaccid
paralysis. Fever with paralysis is
highly suggestive of polio. There
may be signs of neck and back
muscles. Paralysis is descending
starting from hip to come down
to knees. Paralysis reaches its
maximum within 4 days. There is
no specific treatment. Proper
vaccination helps in prevention.

Polishing instruments
are those
instruments that are designed to
perform the polishing and
finishing action once the whole
procedure is completed; it is
mostly used with hand piece.
Finishing burs and stones are
used for smoothing cavity
margins.

Polishing
is a dental procedure that
removes stain, plaque and
acquired pellicle by using an
abrasive polishing paste in a
rubber cup attached to a slowspeed
handpiece. It is a
prophylactic procedure and is
indicated when there are surface
irregularities serving as plaque
trap due to roughness of surface.

Polishing strip
is an abrasive
material placed on a length of
plastic. It is used to smooth and
polish the interproximal areas of
composite restoration.

Polishing instruments
These
generally comprise fine abrasive
stones, wheels, discs and strips.
These are mostly used with a
hand piece.

Polyacid-modified composite resins
contain calcium
aluminium fluorosilicate glass
filler and polyacid components.
They contain either or both
essential components of a GIC,
but are not water based and
therefore no acid–base reaction
can occur. As such, they cannot
strictly be described as GICs.
They set by resin photo
polymerization. The acid–base
reaction occurs in the intra-oral
moisture and allows fluoride
release from the material.

Polyarteritis nodosa
is a non
infective necrotizing vasculitis
involving the small and medium
sized muscular arteries of any
organ. Nodular indurations and
focal dilatations may be seen in
course of affected arteries.

Polychromatic X-ray beam
is a
beam containing many different
wavelengths of varying
intensities.

Polycystic kidney
is the most
common inherited disorder.
There is enlargement of both
kidneys due to focal cystic
dilatation of tubules. There may
be accompanied hepatic cyst and
mitral valve prolapsed. Grossly
kidneys are huge but maintain
shape. Cysts contain clear yellow
fluid to gelatinous red or brown
material in case of hemorrhage.
Infantile polycystic kidney is rare.

Polycythemia is a condition where
there is an abnormal increase in
number of circulating all blood
cells. It is manifested as headache,
dizziness, tinnitus, visual
disturbances and mental
confusion. Skin is flushed or
reddened. Spleen is enlarged.
Gastric belching is common. Oral
mucosa becomes deep purplish
red. Cyanosis in a few cases may
be present. Submucosal petechiae
are also common. RBC count may
go above 10000,000 cells per cubic
millimeter. Bleeding and clotting
time remains normal. Oral
mucosa becomes deep red to
purple and gingiva can be
edematous. Gingiva may bleed
easily. There can be excessive
bleeding after oral surgical
procedures. Total blood volume
rises and blood viscosity
increases. Platelet count is
increased. Serum uric acid level
goes up very high. Complications
may lead to myocardial and
cerebral infarctions. Patients may
develop thrombophlebitis. Over
production of uric acid produces
gout. Acute leukemia is the
terminal stage of Polycythemia.
No specific treatment is available.

are the
oldest type of tooth colored
crown. It consists of an even layer
of porcelain of 1-2 mm thick
covering the entire crown.
Conventional dental porcelain is
more like a glass than what is
used for domestic purposes. It is
relatively brittle and can be
broken easily before cementation.
It has following advantages i.e.
aesthetics, brittleness, dimensional
stability, economical and
resistance to plaque accumulation.
disadvantages includes the
marginal fit and compromise of
tooth substance (see Figure on
page 364).

occurred when adults achieve
peak bone thickness around the
age 20-30 years. After middle age
bones become thin and brittle.
X-ray may show wider, thin
trabaculation known as
osteoporosis.

Portal hypertension
is said to have
occurred where portal vein
pressure is more than 30 mm or
5 mm Hg above inferior vena
cava. It may be caused by portal
vein occlusion. Cirrhosis and

essential part of an emergency set
up. If the patient collapses and
breathing is reduced oxygen is to
be used. Patient breathes a higher
concentration of oxygen.

Post canal pluggers
are spreaders
having a long, tapered smooth
point used to condense the filling
against the canal walls and
obliterate the gaps.

Positive reinforcement
occurs if a
pleasant consequence follows the
response e.g., a child rewarded
for good behavior following
dental treatment.

Post crown

root has been filled. Natural
crown is cut off and a post is fitted
down the root canal. Artificial
crown is made on this post. Post
may be gold casting or of stainless
steel.

these resemble
wood drills used for enlarging
root canals so that a filling can be
inserted. Length of all is same
with increasing range of widths.
Each reamer is numbered. These
are rotated with hands. Reamers
are also available for use in low
speed hand pieces.

manifested by pain in the
distribution of affected area. In
younger patients pain generally
revolves within a few weeks but
in older people pain may
continue for years. Even powerful
analgesics fail.

Post
is an endodontic pin which can
be made with different materials
such as metal or carbon and
placed in the root canal. Its
function usually is to provide
support for a grossly decayed
tooth. It is available in prefabricated
form but can be customised
also according to the morphology
of the canal.

may demonstrate pallor, nausea
and weakness and sweating
which can last from a few minutes
to several hours.

has the
unremitting, bright burning pain
which suggests painful neuritis.
It may be accompanied with
neuritic manifestation. Neuritic
pain is interrupted by paroxysms
of typical neuralgic pain.

Post tussive tongue ulcer
occurs
where the child having whooping
cough presents with an ulcer of
tongue. It is situated on the under
surface near frenulum linguae. It
is round and edge is sloping.
Yellowish or greyish slough is
present at floor. It is soft in
consistence and regional lymph
glands are not enlarged.

Posterior bridge
Bridges replacing
back teeth usually have full
veneer crowns on abutment teeth.

Posterior cerebral artery occlusion
arises from basilar artery and
supplies occipital lobe. On
occlusion visual cortex is affected.
When thalamus is affected
contralateral sensory loss may
develop.

Posterior cranial base length (S-A)
the magnitude of posterior cranial
base length depends on posterior
face height and the position of the
fossa. Short posterior cranial
bases occur in vertical growth
patterns and skeletal open bites
and gives poor prognosis for
functional appliances therapy.

is a nerve
that descends from the main
trunk of the maxillary nerve just
before it enters the infraorbital
canal; the branch provides
sensory innervations to the
pulpal, gingival and osseous
tissues.

Posterior teeth

takes place
after the teeth are functioning to
maintain the position of the
erupted tooth in occlusion while
the jaws are continuing to grow
and compensate for occlusal and
proximal tooth wear.

Postmortem caloricity
occurs
where body instead of coming
down to normal temperature
after death shows a rise of
temperature which persists for an
hour or so. It is due to action of
micro-organisms in living body.
It may happen in tetanus, cholera,
rheumatic fever, abscess and
strychnine poisoning.

Postmortem eye changes
there will
be loss of lusture in the eyes. One
will notice loss of papillary,
corneal and conjuctival reflexes.
Cornea becomes opaque, hazy or
cloudy. It becomes soft and pits
on pressure. Shape of pupil may
change from roundness to oval.

show erosion in mouth and
esophagus. The mucous
membrane of stomach becomes
salty gray with multiple cracks
and fissures. Kidneys are found
enlarged and deeply congested
with minute hemorrhagic spots.
Liver and heart show fatty
degeneration.

color. Irregular patches of bright
red color are found over anterior
surface of body. Blood becomes
fluid and bright red. Lungs are
oedematous. Petechial hemorrhages
are seen on brain and
meninges.

Postmortem lividity
is a reliable
sign of death and gives
information about the position of
the body at the time of death. It
helps to estimate the time since
death and its color may suggest
the cause of death.

is present mostly
intracellular. Diet generally
contains 2 to 4 gram of potassium
daily. Requirement is more
during active growth. About 90%
of excreted from body goes out
through kidney. Death in
potassium deficiency may result
from respiration or cardiac
failure.

spine by blood route. Lesions are
rarely detected within six months
of onset of symptoms. Symptoms
include dull growing pain,
anorexia and low grade fever. It
may start involving in the
intervertebral disc producing
narrowing of disc space. Anterior
collapse results in kyphosis.

Powdered gold
It consists of small
appropriate particles blended
with an organic indicator,
compressed into small spheres
and wrapped in gold foil.
Powdered gold has greater mass
than gold foil. It can be used both
internally and on surface. Because
of density it fills cavity rapidly. It
may be overlaid with gold foil.

may begin. There will be swelling
of hands, face and legs. Headache
and visual disturbance with
altered mental status will be there.
Petechial and bruising may be
noted.

Pre-functional eruptive phase
starts with initiation of root
formation and made by teeth to
move from its position within
bone of the jaw to its functional
position in occlusion. Has an
intraosseous and extraosseous
compartment. It has four stages:
root formation, movement,
penetration, occlusal contact.

Preanesthetic medication
is given
prior to anesthesia in order to
alleviate anxiety, to enhance
narcotic effect of general
anesthetic agent and to minimize
undesirable side effects of general
anesthesia. Benzodiazepines are
commonly used. Usual regime is
to begin tranquillizing drug the
day before the dental operation
and continue a day after.
Hypnotics are good to ensure a
good night’s sleep prior to dental
surgery.

patient in sitting position
complains of a feeling of warmth
in neck and face, loses color (pale
or ashen gray skin color). Patient

increases and presyncope
continues, yawning, increased
depth of respiration and coldness
in hands and feet are noted.

are a
parasternal lift usually indicates
right ventricular hypertrophy,
pulmonary hypertension or left
atrial enlargement.

Predentin (dentinoid)
is a narrow
band of uncalcified predentinal
matrix. It is 20-25 mm in width. It
is situated between the odontoblast
layer and the mineralized
dentin. It signifies a lag period in
the mineralization of the dentin
matrix. It is always present as long
as odontoblasts are present. It is
equal to osteoid in composition.

Predictive theory
that is used to
make predictions based on
relationship between variable.

Predictive validity
is the ability of
a measurement made at one point
in time to predict future status.

Pre-eruption bulge
is a bulge
present in the gingiva before the
eruption of the crown in to the
oral cavity. The bulge is firm,
slightly blanched due to the
pressure of the erupting tooth and
conforms to the contour of
underlying crown.

Pre-eruptive phase
is a phase of
tooth eruption where all
movements of primary and
permanent formation to the time
of crown completion end with
early initiation of root formation.

Pregnancy associated enlargement
may be marginal or gingival or
may occur as a single or multiple
tumors like masses. Enlargement
is mainly related to elevated
hormonal level during pregnancy
which not only increases vascular
permeability but also after the sub
gingival microform with a
predominance of p. intermediate.

Pregnancy epulis
is a soft swelling
on the gum which bleeds easily
and may be painful on ulceration.
Onset is usually at the end of third
month. It is reddish purple
colored swelling on the gum
more frequently seen in anterior
region. It usually regresses after
birth of a child.

Pregnancy gingivitis
becomes
more severe in pregnancy.
Inflammatory erythema and
edema becomes more severe.

Pregnancy Granuloma
is a
hyperactive inflammatory
response due to bacterial plaque
mediated by systematic condition,
it usually occurs during the
1st and 3rd trimester of
pregnancy. It usually appears as
a mushroom like flattened
spherical mass that protrudes
from the gingival margin or interproximal
space and attached by
a sessile or pedunculated base. It
tends to expand laterally and
pressure from tongue and cheek
predestined its flattened appearance.
It is usually seen at upper
anterior teeth. The granuloma
appears dusky red or magenta in
color (Rasberry Like Appearance)
with numerous deep red,
pinpoint markings and a smooth,
glistening surface. It has a semi
firm consistency, but may be soft
and friable, it does not innate the
underlying bone. It bleeds
spontaneously on mild provocation.
It is usually painless, but
painful ulceration many occur if
it interferes with occasion.

stains of fluoride or tetracycline.

Presbyopia
is impaired vision due
to loss of elasticity of lens
especially in old age.

Pressure habits
are those habits
which apply pressure on the oral
soft tissues and hard tissues, thus
having deleterious effect on the
dentition and the oral structures.
These include sucking habits like
lip sucking, finger sucking, and
thumb sucking.

Pressure
is the force applied to a
surface as a force per unit area.

Pressure syringe
is an instrument
with a trigger mechanism that
delivers a measured dose of
anesthetic solution and allows to
express more easily the solution
despite tissue resistance.

Pressure ulcer
is caused by
excessive non relieved pressure.
In animals a pressure of 60 mm
Hg of pressure applied to skin for
1 hour may produce muscle
degeneration/tissue necrosis.
When patient lies on hospital bed
pressure can range from 100-150
mm Hg. Muscle tissue is more
sensitive to ischemia than
overlying skin. Hence necrotic
tissue is usually wider and
deeper. Treatment includes relief
of pressure with special cushions,
beds and nutritional support.

Pressure welding
is a form of
welding in which weld is made
by pressure.

Prevalence
is the number of disease
cases in a population at a given
time.

Prevalence
refers to the total
number of all cases who have an
attribute or disease at a particular
time or during particular period
divided by population at risk of
having the attribute or disease at
this point in time or midway
through the period. Prevalence
refers specifically all current cases
(old and new) existing at as given
point in time or over a period of
time in a given population.

Preventive
a procedure performed
to aid in preventing decay and/
or gum disease.

Preventive dentistry
is that branch
of dental practice that deals with
the establishment and maintenance
of an oral environment
conducive for the prevention of a
sound and healthy stomatognathic
system. The rationale is to
promote optimal health of the oral
tissues and to prevent damage of
any sort.

action taken to preserve the
integrity of what appears to be
normal at a specific time. This
includes early correction of
carious lesions, particularly
proximal caries, early recognition
and elimination of oral habits,
using space maintainers in case of
early loss of deciduous tooth.

Prilocaine
was introduced in 1963.
It is equally effective as
Lignocaine. It contains slight

whereas Lignocaine does not. It
is available in 4% solution without
added vasoconstrictor.

Primary complex
consists of three
lesions (i) Ghon’s focus
(ii) caseous tuberculosis and
(iii) chain of tubercles along with
the lymphatic pathway between

ulcerated and enlarged. Lesions
resolve automatically within
10-14 days.

Primary lymphoid organs
are
thymus for the T cells, bone
marrow for the B cells.These are
the major sites of lymphopoiesis.
Lymphocytes differentiate from
lymphoid stem cells, proliferate
and mature into functional cells.
Lymphocytes acquire them
repertoire of specific antigenic
receptors in order to cope with the
antigenic challenge the individual
receives during life. Learn to
discriminate between selfantigens,
which are tolerated and
non-self antigens, which are not
tolerated.

Primary lymphoma of bone
develops rarely in jaws but
mandible is affected more. Oral
mucosal lesion is ulcerated. Teeth
become loose, maxilla may be
expanded, X-ray shows radiolucency
of alveolar bone. In some
cases periosteal reaction may be
seen. Biopsy confirms the tumor.
Radical surgical excision is
helpful.

Primary neuritic leprosy
Disease
presents with nerve thickening
and loss of sensation without any
skin patches and skin smear
examination is negative. Histological
examination of the involved
nerve shows many L. Laprae with
infiltration by lymphocytes and
histiocytes.

Primary pain
is the source of hyper
excitability that in turn produces
secondary or referred pain. It is
mostly deep somatic of visceral
origin. More continuous, more
severe, longer the duration more
chances of secondary pains to
occur. Referred pains occur most
frequently in structures innervated
by same branch that mediates
the primary pain.

Primary parathyroidism
is due to
adenoma of one of the four
parathyroid glands. Pathological
fracture may be the first sign. Cyst
of jaw may be seen. Generalized
osteoporosis develops. Lobulated
lesion of mandible is to be
differentiated from ameloblastoma.

seen in calvarium. Jaw may give
ground glass appearance.
Excision of parathyroid tumor
will treat the patient.

includes
techniques, designed to prevent
the onset of disease, reverse the
initial stages of disease. It includes
arrest of a disease before treatment
is needed.

Primary syphilis
The characteristic
primary lesion of syphilis is called
‘chancre’ and is a solitary,
painless, indurated, ulcerated or
eroded lesion. To start it develops
as a dull red macule which
becomes eroded. Regional lymph
nodes are enlarged, painless and
are rubbery.

Primary teeth
are also known as
the baby teeth or the primary
dentition.

Primary trauma from occlusion

acid etched surface of tooth. It acts
as a wetting agent. It enhances the
adhesive quality of bond agent.

Primordial cyst
develops through
cystic degeneration and liquefaction
of stellate reticulum. It may
be associated with a retained
erupted deciduous tooth. Unless
infected it is not painful. On X-ray
it is seen as round or ovoid well
demarcated radiolucent lesion. It
will show as a sclerotic border.
Wall of cyst is made up of parallel
bundles of collagen fibers.
Surgical removal is the remedy.

Principal fibers
are the most
important element of the
periodontal ligament which are
collagenous in nature and are
organized in the form of bundles.

themselves but capable of
conversion into vitamins in
course of digestion. Carotenes are
pro vitamins of vitamin A and to
some extent at least, the amino
acid tryptophan can be converted
to niacin.

is an early symptom of a
disease.

Prodrug
is the drug that undergoes
metabolism in the body generally
in liver.

Productive cough
is produced when
the active respiratory efforts expel
the excessive tracheobronchial
secretions. Commonly it results
from infections. About 100 ml of
mucous is produced in the
tracheobronchial tree on daily
basis. It is treated by antibiotics,
steam inhalations and the drugs
which cause softening of sputum.

Professional misconducts
can be
described as unethical acts which
should not be practised ideally.
These include to issue certificate
which are untrue, misleading or
improper. One should not
employ an unqualified assistant.
You are not permitted to canvass
directly or indirectly to promote
practice or keeping touts to
improve your clientage. One
should not disclose the secrets of
patients. Improper relations with
patients of opposite sex are not
allowed.

Professional responsibility
is the
obligation to fulfill specific
requirement to maintain expertise
and knowledge associated with
profession.

Prognosis
is a prediction of a
course, duration and outcome of
a disease once the disease is
present. The prognosis can be
described in various forms such
as excellent prognosis, good prognosis,
fair prognosis, poor prognosis,
questionable prognosis and
hopeless prognosis.

Prolactin
is called lactogenic
hormone. It promotes milk
production in women. Its target
organ is breast. If the lactating
mother continues to breast feed
hormone level remains high.

Prolonged anesthesia
is a condition
where patient experiences
numbness for many hours or days
following a local anaesthetic
injection. It may result due to
irritation to the nerve after
injection of a contaminated
anaesthetic agent. The ensuing
edema places pressure on the
nerve. Persistent anesthesia also
results from trauma to the nerve
sheath.

Promyelocyte
is larger than
Myeloblast. Chromatin is coarser
but nucleoli are present.
Cytoplasm is basophilic with a
small number of prominent large
red granules.

Propanidid Epontal

oily viscous liquid. It is a derivative
of eugenol. It is less potent
and is available for injection in 5%
solution dose varies from 5-7 mg
per kg body weight. It brings
rapid unconsciousness and maintains
anesthesia for 2-3 minutes.
There becomes a transient fall of
BP for 2-3 minutes. Its period of
narcotic activity is short.

Prophy paste
is an abrasive agent
usually made from floor of
pumice that is used to remove
plaque and polish the tooth.

Prophylaxis
is a general meaning
to clean the teeth, also known as
a prophy. Prophylaxis is a
procedure designed to prevent
the onset of disease.

Propionic acid
is an NSAIDS and
Ibuprofen is the main drug. These
are better tolerated as compared
to other NSAIDS like phenyl
butazone. It is better tolerated
than aspirin in terms of G.I.T.
disturbances. It is one of safest
drug. Its half life is of 2 hours
similar to paracetamol. Abdominal
dyspepsia may be a side
effect.

Proprioreceptor
are those receptors
located in muscles, tendons and
joints. These allow body to
recognize the position of the
body. Proprioreceptor are also the
pain receptors involved in
automatic functioning and
perceive movement, pressure and
position free nerve endings, deep
somatic pain and other
sensations.

Propronolol
is a widely used beta
receptor antagonist. It blocks all
beta adrenergic receptors. It
reduces heart rate and cardiac
output. The force of myocardial
contraction and blood pressure
are reduced. Response of heart to
exercise and exertion is diminished.
It is used in angina, cardiac
arrhythmias and hypertension. It
can also be used in hyperthyroidism.

Prosopagnosia
is a agnosia for
faces. It has an acute onset and is
due to involvement of cerebral
artery. He cannot recognize face
but recognizes person from voice
and movements. Prosopagnosia
which persists beyond a month is
due to bilateral lesions at the level
of lingual and fusiform gyri.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
is a vasoactive
eicosanoid produced by
monocytes and fibroblasts,
induces bone resorption and matrix
metalloproteinase secretion.
Evidence that prostaglandin could
mediate bone resorption was first
reported by Klein and Raisz in
1970 and a role for prostaglandin
in periodontal bone loss soon
followed (Goldhaber 1971) Prostaglandin
E2 exhibits a broad
range of pro inflammatory effects.
It contributes to the flare and
wheal effects by inducing vasodilatation
and increasing capillary
permeability, and these effects are
enhanced by synergism with other
inflammatory mediators. Prostaglandins
sensitize nociceptors to
different types of stimuli, thus
lowering their pain thresholds to
all types of stimulation. Prostaglandin
E increases the response of
slowly adapting Admethane
receptors to non-noxious stimuli.

Prosthesis
is a replacement of a
missing body part.

Prosthetic instruments
include
plaster knife, wax knife and
Lecron carver.

Prosthodontics
is concerned with
restoration of natural teeth and
contiguous oral and maxillofacial
tissues with artificial substitute.
Specialist is known as prosthodontist.

Protamine Zinc insulin
is a result
of combination of protamine and
insulin. Addition of zinc produces
depression of blood sugar. Little
effect is observed for 3-4 hours
and takes 12 hours before the
maximum activity is produced. It
may be active even 24 hours after
injection.

Proteins
means necessary for life
because vital parts of nucleus and
protoplasm are made up of
proteins only. One sixth of body
weight is made up of proteins.
Proteins contain 16% nitrogen.
Daily requirement is 1 gm per kilo
gram of body weight.

Proteolysis-chelation theory
According to this theory,
decalcification is mediated by a
variety of complexing agents, such
as acid anions, amines, amino
acids, peptides polyphosphates,
and carbohydrate derivatives.
Oral karatinolytic bacteria are
thought to be involved in the
process. Differences in the keratin
content of the enamel in children
with high caries and low caries
experience are considered
important. It should be noted that
only a small fraction of the protein
of enamel bears any resemblance
to the keratin of hair. Schatz and
Martin challenged the chemoparasitic
theory advocated the
proteolysis – Chelation theory
and stated that acid may prevent
tooth decay by interfering with
growth and activity of proteolytic
bacteria.

Proteolytic theory
According to
this theory, the organic
component is most vulnerable
and is attacked by hydrolytic
enzymes of microorganisms, this
precedes the loss of the inorganic
phase. Gottlieb (1944) maintained
that the initial action was due to
proteolytic enzymes attacking the
lamellae, rod sheaths, tufts and
walls of the dentinal tubules. He
suggested that a coccus, probably
staphylococcus aureus, was
involved because of the yellow
pigmentation that he considered
pathgnomonic of dental caries.
Frisbie (1944) also described
caries as a proteolytic process
involving depolymerization and
liquefaction of the organic matrix
of enamel. The less soluble
inorganic salts could then be freed
from their “organic bond”
favoring their solution, by
acidogenic bacteria that
secondarily penetrate along
widening paths. Pincus (1949)
contended that proteolytic
organisms first attacked the
protein elements, such as the
dental cuticle and then destroyed
the prism sheaths. The loosened
prisms would then fall out
mechanically. He also suggested
that sulfatases of gram-negative
bacilli hydrolyzed “mucoitin
sulfate” of enamel or chondroitin
sulphate of dentin and produced
sulfuric acid. The released
sulfuric acid could combine with
the calcium of the mineral phase.
It should be noted that the
composition of the organic
components of enamel does not
resemble that of connective tissue
and an abundance of sulphated
polysaccharides has not been
demonstrated. The Pincus’ theory
remains, therefore, without
experimental support.

Prothrombin time
measures the
patient’s ability to form a clot. It
is performed by measuring the
time it takes for a clot to form
when calcium and a tissue factor
are added to plasma. It is between
11 and 16 seconds. Prolonged
prothrombin time is associated
with post operative bleeding.

Proton
is a positively charged
particle.

Protrusion
refers to the movement
of the mandible anteriorly from
ICP.

Provisional
means temporary.

Provisional diagnosis
refers to the
term where the diagnosis is based
on clinical impression without
any investigations. Provisional
prognosis is that stage where it
allows the clinician to start with
the best available treatment that
has questionable prognosis and at
the same time hope for the
favorable response which may
shift the balance and help in
controlling the disease.

Provitamins
are vitamin related
compounds that can be converted
to active vitamins in body such as
tryptophan can be converted to
vitamin niacin, carotene to
Vitamin A and cholesterol to
Vitamin D.

Proximal Caries–susceptible zone
This region extends from the
contact point down to the height
of the free gingival margin. It
increases with the recession of the
alveolar bone and gingival tissues.

Proximal half crown
is a ¾ crown
that is rotated 90°, and distal
rather than buccal surface left
intact. It can be a retainer on a
tilted mandibular FPD abutment.
This design can be used only in
mouth with excellent hygiene and
low incidence of inter proximal
caries. It is contra indicated if
there is blemish on distal surface.

Proximal
is the nearest point of
attachment.

Proximal surface
is the surface of the
tooth adjacent to the next tooth.

Pseudo cysts
are that cyst that
doesn’t have epithelial lining and
hence are not true cysts.

Pseudo pocket
refer gingival
pocket.

Pseudomembrane
is a membranous
layer of exudates. It
contains precipitated fibrin,
organisms, necrotic cells
produced by an inflammatory
reaction on the surface of tissue.

Psoriasis
is characterized by thick
elevated, scaling, erythromatous
plaque. There develops small,
sharply delineated, dry papules,
each covered by silvery scales like
mica. On removal of these scales
bleeding points may be seen.
Cutaneous lesions are painless.
Papules enlarge and become
raised. New lesions slowly arise
over weeks/months. Oral
mucosa is rarely involved but lips
may be involved. On treatment
may subside for sometime then
may reappear. Long term
cortisone is used.

Psuedomembranous candidiasis
is
also known as thrush. It is an acute
infection but may persist
intermittently for months using
corticosteroids topically or aerosol
in HIV infected individuals. It has
white membrane on the surface of
oral mucosa, tongue and
elsewhere. Confluent plaques can
be scrapped leaving a raw
erythematous bleeding base.
White patches consist of necrotic
material and desquamated
epithelium.

Psychoanalytical theory
According
to this theory oral habits are
the product of pleasure, child
derives from stimulation of oral
erogenous zone. The pleasure
derived may be sexual or escape
from a painful situation, as in case
of infant who sucks when he is
hungry. The habit is associated
with pleasurable stimuli early in
life but is not discarded at the
usual time due to some
underlying psychological disturbance.
Proponents of this theory
reason that if the habit is taken
away from such an emotionally
disturbed child, the child may
substitute an even less desirable
one in its place. One of the
concepts of thumb-sucking that is
brought about by the psychoanalytic
theory is that humans
possess a biologic sucking drive.
This concept is supported by the
observation of intrauterine
sucking and by the neonatal reflex
of rooting and placing, as
described by Benjamin (1967). In
the rooting reflex, if a well defined
area around the mouth is touched
by an object opens the mouth. The
placing reflex is the sucking
activity that occurs with the object
making contact with the infant’s
mouth.

Psychodynamics
is psychoanalysis.
It includes motivations, perception
and emotions.

Psychogenic headache
occurs in
neurotic, hyptochondrical or
hysterical individual. The character
is like a sense of pressure or
like a tight constricting band.

Psychogenic malodor
The halitosis
may be attributable to a form of
delusion of mono-symptomatic
hypochondriasis (self-halitosis;
halitophobia). Such patients
rarely wish to visit a psychological
specialist because they fail
to recognize their own psychological
condition and may have
latent psychosomatic tendencies.

Psychogenic pain
is a psychic and
emotional states influencing pain
perception and its expression.
These patients are emotionally
disturbed and are very common
in young women. Such pain can
continue for days together.

Psychological dependence
is
characterized by intense craving
and compulsive perpetuation of
abuse to repeat the desire of the
drug. But not necessarily
everybody taking the drugs may
be an addict or drug dependent.

Psychology
is the science dealing
with human nature, function and
phenomenon of his soul.

Psychophysiological
is a measurement
of physiological process in
an effort to draw conclusions
about psychological states.

Psychosexual theory
Sigmond
Freud in the year 1905 was the
originator at psychoanalytical
approach. He thought that personality
development, is a result
of satisfaction of a sex. He categorized
it into different psychosexual
stages. At each stage sexual
energy is integrated in a particular
part called erogenous zone.
Two categories in concept of
Freudian theory first describe
level of consciousness (or) awareness;
the second function component
is personality. He proposed
3 basic psychic structures for personality
of individual. There are
three level of consciousness they
are: 1. Conscious- part of personality,
of which is aware of thought
feelings for basic activities. 2. Preconscious-
part of personality of
which individual is not aware at
the moment however able to recollect
into awareness without
great difficulty. 3. Unconsciouspart
of personality of which individual
is unaware, which generally
cannot brought into awareness
without the help of assistant.

Psychosocial theory
In Erickson’s
view “Psychosocial development
proceeds by critical steps –
‘critical’ are characteristics of
turning points, of moments of
decision between progression
integration and retardation. Each
stage represents a “psychosocial
crisis” which is influenced by
social environment. Chronological
ages are associated with
Erickson’s developmental stages
as in physical development, the
chronological age varies among
individuals but developmental
stage remains constant. Unlike
Freud, Erickson emphasis the
conscious self as much as
unconscious instincts.

Psychosomatic
is pertaining to
mind body relationship.

Pterygium
is a triangular fold of
conjunctiva encroaching the
cornea in the horizontal meridian.
It may come from single or both
sides of conjunctiva. It may be
thick, fleshy and vascular
associated with opaque spots in
the cornea.

Pterygomaxillary fissure
is a cleft
that separates the lateral
pterygoid plate and maxilla.

Puberty
is the period between the
ages of 12-15 years in girls and
between 13-16 years in boys.
During which secondary sexual
characteristics develop and
become expressed.

Public health
is defined as ‘the
organized application of local,
state, national and international
resources to achieve ‘Health for
all’ i.e. attainment by all people
of the world by the year 2000 ‘of
a level of health that will permit
them to lead a socially and
economically productive life.

Puddings
are customary in formal
dinners being served as the
finishing item. In the process of
eating food one loses certain
amount of energy. To compensate
lost energy it easily absorbs
readymade glucose/fructose/
levulose. That is why after
15 minutes of taking puddings
one feels energetic.

Pulmonary hypertension
is the
counter part in the lungs of
systemic hypertension. There is
hyperplasia of medial coat of
vessels. Second feature is
ventricular hypertrophy.

Pulmonary infarction
is an infarct,
an area of coagulation necrosis
produced by a sudden cut off of
arterial supply but in the lungs
there may be vascular occlusion
without infarction and there may
be infarction without vascular
occlusion. The infarct is always a
red infarct because of dual blood
supply. It is a wedge or pyramid
shaped.

Pulp calcification
may be discrete
as pulp stones or diffuse
calcification. Diffuse calcification
is seen in the canals of teeth
known as calcific degeneration. It
is an amorphous, unorganised
linear strand.

Pulp canal
is a portion of pulp
cavity located in root area. The
constricted opening at root apex
is known as apical foramen
through which nutrient and nerve
supply enter.

Pulp capping
is a procedure done
when vital pulp is exposed, either
root filling or pulp otomy is done
to conserve the tooth. It cannot be
done immediately so pulp
capping is a valuable temporary
measure. The exposed part is
covered with calcium hydroxide
paste and cavity paste. Cavity is
filled with temporary cement.

Pulp chamber
is the largest
enlarged portion of pulp cavity
found in coronal portion of tooth
and has pulpal norms. It is the
portion of the pulp in the crown
of the tooth.

Pulp horn
is the portion of the pulp
chamber that extends towards the
cusp.

Pulp
is a delicate connective tissue
of mesenchymal origin found in
central portion of a tooth
surrounded by dentin. It is
composed of blood vessels,
connective tissue, special dentin
formation cells called odontoblasts.
Composition includes
cells, intercellular substance, and
tissue fluid. Cells are the
fibroblast, histocytes,
undifferentiated mesenchymal
cells and odontoblasts. Zones of
the Pulp - Odontoblastic zone –
outermost layer, Cell free zone,
Cell rich zone. Functions of the
Pulp is formative, sensory,
nutritive, and defensive.

Pulp tissue
is the soft (not calcified)
tissue in the pulp chamber;
composed of blood vessels and
nerves.

Pulp-Dentin complex
is the close
relationship between odontoblasts
and dentin, sometimes
referred to as the pulp-dentin
complex, is one of the several
reasons why dentin and pulp
should be considered as a
functional entity. Not only do the
two tissues have a common
embryonic origin, but they also
remain in an intimate relationship
throughout the life of the vital
tooth. Anything that affects
dentin will affect the pulp and
vice-versa. In other words, pulp
lives for the dentin and the dentin
lives by the grace of the pulp.

Pulpectomy
is the removal of the
whole pulp inside a tooth.

Pulpitis irreversible
is an inflammation
of the dental pulp in
which pulp will not recover and
will require endodontic treatment.

Pulpotomy
“amputation of the affected
or infected coronal portion
of the dental pulp preserving the
vitality and function of all or part
of remaining radicular pulp”
(AAPD 1996).

Pulpotomy
can be defined as
procedures involving removal of
vital, partially inflamed coronal
pulp tissue and placing a dresser
over the amputated pulp stumps
and then place the final
restoration”. (DB Prosthetic
instruments: These include
plaster knife, wax knife and
Lecron carver. Kennedy 1986).

Pulpotomy
is complete removal of
the coronal portion of the dental
pulp followed by placement of a
suitable dressing or medicament
that will promote healing and
preserve the vitality of the tooth”
(Finn 1995).

Pulse
is produced by the force
imparted to arterial blood each
time the left ventricle contracts
and expels blood into aorta. Pulse
travels to wrist taking 0.1 to 0.2
seconds after the contraction.
Pulse wave depends on the stroke
volume, the force of expulsion
and rigidity of blood vessels.

Pulseless disease
also known as
Takayasu’s disease is rare of
unknown cause. In branches of
aorta stenosis, occlusion and
aneurysms may occur. Early
disease is accompanied by fever,
myalgias, arthralgias and pain
over involved artery. There may
be syncope, dizziness, stroke,
angina and claudication.

Pulses alternans
when the left
ventricle is severely diseased, it
characteristically develops
alternate strong and weak beats.

Pulses
are the rich source of
proteins. Price wise the proteins
of pulses are cheaper than
proteins of animal origin per unit.
Hence pulses are known as poor
man’s meat. Pulses contain
20-25% of protein. Pulse proteins
are class II proteins. It contains
fair amount of calcium and iron.
Pulses are rich in lysine but poor
in methionine. If taken with
wheat rotis, it compensates.
During sprouting concentration
of vitamin C increases.

Pumice
is a ground volcanic ash
used for polishing.

Punched out papillae
is a cratered
papillae characteristic of acute
necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.

Punctate
resembles or marked with
dots/points.

Punishment
involves introduction
of an aversive stimulus into a
situation to decrease the undesirable
behavior, e.g., use of parental
rake in correction of tongue.

Purple lesions
are some vascular
lesions appearing blue while
some may appear purple. Purple
color is due to basic bluish color
being modified by normal pink
mucosa. Purple vascular lesions
are bullae while purple lesions
resulting from deposition of
pigments are usually nodules or
tumors.

Purpura
is a reddish blue or purplish
discoloration of skin or mucosa
resulting from deficiency in
blood platelets or increase in capillary
fragility. It results in oozing
of blood from gingiva. Petechiae
and echymoses may be present.
It is the extravasations of small
amount of blood into mucous
membrane. It generally develops
in young adults. Bleeding spots
on skin or mucosal surfaces,
epistaxis, hematuria and hematemesis
are common. Intracranial
hemorrhage may produce
hemiplegia. Bleeding in joints
may limit its movements. Spleen
is not enlarged. Gingival bleeding
and palatal ecchymosis is seen,
Bleeding in temporomandibular
joint result in pain, Trismus may
develop. Muscle bleeding may
result in closing and opening of
mouth. Steroid therapy and
repeated transfusions help.

Putrefaction
starts immediately
after death at cellular level. It is
due to action of many enzymes.
Chief destructive bacterial agent
is Clostridium Welchi which
causes marked hemolysis. First
sign is greenish discoloration of
skin over caecum where the
content of bowel is more fluid and
full of bacteria putrefaction starts
above 10° C and optimum at 21° C
to 38° C. Organs containing water
decomposes early. Fat and flabby
bodies decompose early.

Pyelitis
is more commonly known
as pyelonephritis. There may be
high fever and acute severe rigor.
Several bouts of fever may come
in a day. There will be frequency,
urgency and burning in
micturation. Pain may be radiated
to lumbar region. Kidney area
becomes tender. Urine will show
pus cells. RBC’s and albumin.
E.coli is the causative factor.

Pyknodysostosis
is transmitted by
an autosomal recessive trait with
increased bone density, dwarfism
and skeletal fragility. Patient is
short statured. Dentition is
anomalous and palate is high and
arched. Hands and feet are stubby
and finger clubbing is noted
Osteosclerosis is most prominent
in long bones. Facial bones and
sinuses are hypoplastic. Mandibular
hypoplasia with an obtuse
angle results in receding jaw.

Pyogenic granuloma
is a tumor like
non specific conditioned enlargement
in repose to minor plasma.
It is usually seen on gingiva, but
may also arise from lips, tongue
and buccal mucosa. Lesion varies
from a discrete spherical tumor
like mass to a flattened, keloid like
enlargement with a broad base. It
is usually bright red or purple in
color with a friable or fruits
consistency. It bleeds on slight
promulgation. Surface may show
ulceration and purulent exudates
may be present. It is painless.
Surgical excision is the treatment.

Pyorrhea
is a purulent discharge of
pus.

Pyostomatitis vegetans
is an
uncommon inflammatory
disease. There develops large
number of broad based papillary
projections with tiny abscesses.
Tongue is involved more. Buccal
mucosa gives a cobble stone
appearance.

Pyraxolones
is a most potent
NSAID but the adverse effects are
serious. It may cause agranulocytosis.
It relieves pain of
rheumatoid arthritis. It has
unusual sodium retaining power
hence has to be avoided in
hypertension and renal disease.

Pyridoxine Vitamin B6
was
discovered by Gyorgyi in 1936.
Vitamin exists in three forms
pyridoxine, pyridoxal and
pyridoxamine. It plays a vital role
of metabolism in amino acids.
Liver, meat, fish, whole cereals
are rich source of it. Treatment
with INH and oral contraceptives
may cause its deficiency. If diet is
containing 100 gm of protein the
requirement is 1.25 mg. its
deficiency may cause glossitis,
dizziness and vomiting. Morning
sickness of pregnancy also
responds to it. Daily requirement
depends upon consumption of
total quantity of protein. Oral
manifestations include angular
chelitis, glossitis, stomatitis, and
atrophy of papillae on dorsum of
tongue.

Pyrogen
is a substance or agent
producing fever.

Q-sort
is a survey
research technique in
which respondents
generate is forced to
choice ranking of
many alternatives.

Quadrant
denotes one
of four equal sections
in the mouth. The
upper right, upper
left, lower right or the
lower left.

Quadriplegia
means paralysis of all
the four limbs and trunks. It is the
resultant of spinal cord disease or
fracture. There will be clumsiness
of leg movements or unsteadiness
of gait and other walking problems.
Quadriplegia is due to cervical
cord lesion. The ipsilateral
lesion is involved first, followed
in sequence by weakness of ipsilateral
leg, the contralateral leg
and finally the contralateral arm.
Peripheral neuropathy produces
symmetrical distal muscle weakness
(see Figure on page 383).

Qualitative research
is a research
paradigm based in part on
assumption of multiple
constructed realities. There is
independence of investigator and
participant, time and context
dependency information.

Quantitative light induced fluorescence
is the technique
used for caries detection. The use
Q of fluorescence for the detection
of caries dates back 1929, when
Benedict observed normal teeth
fluoresce under ultraviolet
illumination. He suggested that
fluorescence might be useful in
the determination of dental caries
when monochromatic light is
used at 350 nm, 410 nm and
530 nm. Additionally, he noted a
difference in fluorescence between
sound and caries enamel. In the
carious lesions the emission
spectra shifts to more than 540 nm
or the red range of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The
largest difference between the
carious and non-carious spectra is
found at 600 nm. He stated that
when the enamel is illuminated
with light in the blue-green range,
the observable fluorescence
occurs in the green-yellow range.

Quartan fever
is said to have occured
when two days intervene between
consecutive attacks of fever.

occured when a paroxysm of
intermittent fever occurs daily.

Rabies encephalitis
is
a disease that spreads
along peripheral
nerves to reach CNS
(central nervous system).
One may develop
severe anxiety, speech
and psychomotor over
activity. Dysphagia
and spasm of throat muscles may
take place. Coma follows and
death is due in 4-7 days.

Radiation
is the emission and
propagation of energy through
space or material in the form of
waves or stream of particles.

Radiation scatter
is a form of
secondary radiation, resulting
from an X-ray beam that has been
deflected from the path.

Radicular atrophy of pulp teeth
are
symptomless and respond normally
to vacuolated spaces. Odontoblasts
start disappearing. It may
result due to improper fixation of
tooth and pulp after extraction.

Radicular dentin dysplasia
is
inherited as autosomal dominant
trait. It is characterized by teeth
with normal crowns and
abnormal tooth-roots. Radiograph
will show partial lack of
pulp chambers and root canals.
Color of tooth is normal. Roots are
short. Pulp chamber of permanent
teeth are not obliterated.

Radio isotopes
of certain elements
or compounds when injected in
to tissue get incorporated in the
developing bone and act as in vivo
markers. The radioisotopes can
later be detected by tracking
down the radioactivity they emit.

Radio surgery
is a surgical technique
that uses radio waves to
produce a pressure less, bloodless
incision.

Radiograph
refers to an X-ray
picture.

Ramford Index teeth
are those six
index teeth that are often used
when evaluating periodontal
health i.e. maxillary right first
molar, left central incisor, left first
premolar, mandibular left first
molar, right central incisor and
right first premolar. These teeth
are used in clinical trial research
as a representative sample of
entire dentition.

Rampant
means spreading unchecked.

Randomization
is a statistical
procedure by which the
participants are allocated into
groups called study and control
groups. It is an attempt to
eliminate the vias. It is a ‘high’
point of control trial.

Randomized clinical trial
is a
clinical research in which subjects
are randomly assigned to
treatment and control groups.

Ranula
is a special type of mucocele
which occurs on floor of the
mouth from trauma of submandibular
or sublingual gland. It is
slowly enlarging painless mass on
one side of the floor. A lesion is
deep seated and mucosa over it
is normal. Some prefer to excise
entire sublingual gland.

Rape
is an unlawful sexual
intercourse by a man with his
own wife under the age of 15
years or any other women under
the age of 16 years or above that
age against her will or when her
consent has been taken by putting
her in fear of death or hurt or
when the man knows that he is
not her actual husband as the lady
believes.

Raphe
is a union of soft tissue.

Rapid cell growth
refers to most
malignant type of cell or tumors
that grow in rapid and invasive
fashion, while benign tumors
grow in a slow, expansile manner.
Most neoplasms arise from a
single stem cells.

Recession
is the exposure of root
surface by an apical shift in the
position of the gingiva. The
recession may be of two types:
one, which is clinically apparent
and other, the hidden one, which
can be determined only by the
insertion of probe. Recession may
also be localized to one tooth or a
group of teeth.

Recovery period
is the illness that
subsided has and patient returns
to health during this period.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)
refers to the condition
where there is development of
painful, recurring solitary or
multiple recurring ulcers confined
to oral mucosa with no other signs
of disease. These have been
classified as recurrent aphthous
minor and major. These ulcers
begin as a single or multiple
superficial erosion covered by
gray membrane. It is well
circumscribed by erythematous
halo. Lesions are very painful and
patient is not able to eat. In one
outbreak number of ulcer may go
up to 100. Size may vary from
2-3 mm Size of the minor ulcers is
less than 1 cm. These ulcers heal
without scar formation. They may
start after trauma, menstruation or
contact with certain foods. Within
hours a small white papule forms,
ulcerates and gradually enlarges
over the period of next 72 hours.
Lesions are round, symmetric and
shallow. Multiple lesions are
present. Lesions heal slowly and
leave scars.

Recurrent gingivitis
can be
described as the recurrence of
disease after it has been eliminated.

Recurrent herpes simplex
is a viral
infection where there is a
prodromal period of tingling or
burning. Edema is followed by
clusters of small vesicles of 1 to 3
mm. Bigger lesions may cause
discomfort. Large, frequent,
painful or disfiguring lesions
require consultation. Oral
acyclovir is effective.

Red blood cells
carry hemoglobin
and has a life span of 120 days.
The cell is flexible, biconcave disc.
Majority are of disc form and
minority are bowl shaped,
normocytic are of normal size and
normochromic are having normal
amount of hemoglobin. RBCs
carry oxygen from lungs to the
tissues and return in venous
blood with carbon dioxide to
lungs. Lack of RBCs count may
result in anemia.

Red-green color blindness
is said
to have occured when a single
group of color receptive cones is
missing from the eye. The person
is unable to distinguish some
colors from others or when
person is lacking either red or
green types of cones, person is
known as red green color blind.

Reduction of a fracture
means the
restoration of a functional alignment
of the bony fragments.

Referred pain
is generally described
when there is a close segmental
relationship between the
primary initiating pain and secondary
effects of noxious stimulus.
Most secondary symptoms
occur in structures innervated by
the same major nerve that mediates
the primary pain. Sensory
effects resulting in referred pain
and secondary hyperalgesias.
(e.g. angina pectoris radiates to
the top of the left shoulder). The
exact mechanism is unclear but
appears to depend on convergence
of afferent inputs on to central
neurons from both the source
and the referred sites, in addition
to central summation (see Figure
on page 387).

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy
is a
minor form of causalgia involving
face/mouth. It has all the features
of autonomic reflex pain. It may
follow trauma, surgery or
infection. It is a dull, persistent,
diffusely located burning symptom.
It is arrested by a diagnostic
analgesic block of the stellate
ganglion.

Refractory periodontitis
has been
defined as those patients who are
unresponsive to any type of
treatment provided.

Refractory
refers to a heat resisting
material i.e. capable of resisting
high temperature.

Regeneration
is the growth and
differentiation of new cells to
form new tissues or parts of the
body.

Regional odontodysplasia
affects
more of maxillary teeth. Etiology
is unknown. There is either a
delay or a total failure in eruption.
Shape is irregular with defective
mineralization. Tooth assumes a
ghost appearance. There is
marked reduction in dentin.
Reduced enamel shows many
irregular calcified bodies.

Regulation of body temperature
is
maintained at 98° F. Hypothalamus
controls it. Three structures
within skin assist in body
temperature, blood vessels, sweat
glands and muscle contraction.

Rehabilitation
is the combined and
co-ordinated use of medical,
social, educational and vocational
measure for training and
retraining the individual to the
highest possible level of
functional ability. It includes all
measures to reduce the effect of
disability.

Reiter’s syndrome
is a clinical
tetrad of non specific uretheritis,
conjunctivitis, uveitis, mucocutaneous
lesions and arthritis.
Arthritis is asymmetric and
involves weight bearing joints. It
is totally confined to man
between 20-30 years. Oral lesions
are painless, red, elevated areas
with a white border on buccal
mucosa, lips and gingiva. The
palatal lesions appear as small,
bright red pupuric spots. Antibiotics
and corticosteroids help.
Disease may undergo spontaneous
remission.

Relative humidity
is the percentage
of moisture present in the air,
complete saturation being taken
as 100. Greater the relative
humidity nearer is the air to
saturation. If relative humidity is
more than 65% in a room, person
feel sticky and uncomfortable.
Better ventilation lowers down
the humidity.

Relative polycythemia
is a condition
occurring due to decreased
plasma volume and not to
increase in RBCs. It can be caused
by diuretic use, diarrhea and
excessive sweating.

Remittent fever
is said to have
occured when daily fluctuation of
fever is said to have occured
varies more than 2° C.

Remodelling
is the major pathway
of bony changes in shape,
resistance to forces, repair of
wounds and calcium and
phosphate homeostasis in body.

Remodelling of callus
is always
over abundance of newbone
produced to strengthen the
healing site because it may
contain a dead bone also. These
fragments are slowly resorbed
and replaced by mature type of
bone. External callus is
remodelled to give a shape.

Removable functional appliances
are the myofunctional appliances
that can be removed and inserted
into the mouth by patient the
mselves e.g. activator and
bionator.

Removable habit breakers
are a
passive removable appliance that
consist of a crib and is anchored
to the oral cavity by means of
clasps on the posterior teeth.

Renal amyloidosis
refers to a
condition where kidneys become
white and enlarged. They have
smooth surface and widened pale
cortex. Microscopically amyloid
deposits are seen in glomeruli
appearing in meningeal region.
Deposits obliterate capillary
lumen. Amyloidal deposits are
also seen in blood vessels.

Renal artery stenosis
is produced
by atherosclerotic occlusive
disease. It may cause renovascular
hypertension and ischemic
nephropathy.

Renal calculi
may be of various
types. Pain travels from ribs to
vertebral angle to flank. Pain may
excruciate if it is horny and travels
down the ureters. When stones
are in renal pelvis it causes
constant dull pain. 70-75% of
renal stone are purely calcium
oxalate or calcium oxalate +
calcium phosphate. 15% of calculi
consist of magnesium ammonium
phosphate. 10% stones are of uric
acid. Stones may be present with
or without symptoms but when
these pass down to ureters may
produce renal colic. There
develop hematuria. Urinary
infection causes dysuria. About
60% small stones pass
spontaneously.

Renal cell carcinoma
is usually
solitary, unilateral tumor. It is
seen at upper pole in elderly age
group. These are solitary,
unilateral tumors, a golden
yellow circumscribed mass.
Large areas of hemorrhage,
necrosis and cystic changes give
variegated appearance. It spreads
by blood stream.

Renal cortical adenoma
is small
0.5 to 3 cm grey or greyish yellow
nodule in cortex. There may be
scars of atherosclerosis. Microscopically
these show clear cells.
Cells show uniform nuclei and no
mitosis. Less than 3 cms are
benign.

Renal cortical necrosis
is of 2 types
i.e. Diffuse of patchy. Diffuse
bilateral cortical necrosis with
sparing of medulla is very
uncommon. When present it is an
evidence of renal failure. Renal
cortical necrosis may be seen in
gram negative endotoxic shock
and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
In some lesion may be patchy.
Patient may develop sudden
oliguria, anuria or hematuria.

Renal edema
in acute
glomerulonephritis is due to
retention of sodium and water
due to fall in glomerular filtration
rate. Distribution of edema is in
loose tissues, face and around the
eyes. Fluid is transudate.

Renal hamartomas
are often
bilateral. It shows mixture of
irregular fibrous and fatty tissue
blood vessels and smooth muscle
cells. It may be associated with
fibroma’s and lipomas.

Renal transplant
is an accepted
modality of treatment of chronic
renal failure and end stage renal
disease. In order to suppress the
rejection, immunosuppression
with a single or combination of
drugs is achieved.

Renal tuberculosis
is common in
India. Patient develops urinary
symptoms and abacterial pyuric
recurrent cystitis I.V.P. will show
irregularity, cavitation,
calcification and diminished renal
function. Demonstration of
tubercle bacilli is the most specific
test. It results from hematogenous
seeding of renal cortex to form
small caseous foci and spread to
medulla. Eventually loss of
function with hydronephrosis
develops.

Repair
is the process which restores
the continuity of the disease and
re-establishes a normal tissue.

in male’s
includes testes, prostate and
seminal vesicle while in females
it includes ovaries, fallopian
tubes, uterus and vagina.

is a statement
that makes predictions about the
expected outcome of study,
contrast and null hypothesis.

Reserpine
is a rauwolfia alkaloids.
It blocks postganglionic sympathetic
nerve endings. It reduces
peripheral sympathetic tone. Its
central effect reduces anxiety. It
is used as hypotensive agent.
Long term use in females may
cause carcinoma of breast.

Residual volume
is the volume of
air in the lungs which cannot be
expelled.

Resilience
is the energy needed to
deform a material to the proportional
limit.

Resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGIs)
resin-modified glass
ionomers were developed to
overcome the problems of moisture
sensitivity and low initial
mechanical strength of GICs.
They consist of a GIC with an
added resin system that allows
light setting followed by the acid–
base reaction of the glass ionomer.
This occurs within the light-polymerized
resin framework. The
resin increases fracture strength
and wear resistance. Adhesion is
enhanced by the use of enamel
and dentine-conditioning agents
before placement.

Resorb
is to dissolve into the tissue.

Resorption of teeth
in addition to
deciduous teeth the roots of permanent
teeth may also undergo
resorption. External resorption
may be due to periapical inflammation,
reimplantation of teeth,
tumors or cysts, impaction of
teeth and idiopathic. Resorption
of primary dentition is physiological
in nature where as
resorption of permanent dention
is pathological in nature.

Respiratory acidosis
occurs due to
depression of carbon dioxide
washout. It may be caused by
depression of respiratory center
by drugs; patient may develop
anorexia, confusion, mental
disturbance. PaCO2 is elevated
and ph is decreased. HCO3 is
increased.

Respiratory exchange ratio
is the
ratio of oxygen uptake to CO2
output at rest and during exercise.

Resting plaque
refers to plaque
2-2.5 hours after the last intake
of dietary carbohydrate as
opposed to starved “plaque”
which has not been exposed to
carbohydrate for 8 - 12 hours.
Resting plaque ph is usually
between 6 and 7 whereas the
starved plaque ph is normally
between 7 and 8. A large range of
plaque pH values seem to be
compatible with oral health, but
due to the multifactorial nature of
dental caries, what may be
healthy for one individual may be
unhealthy for another. Resting
plaque contains relatively high
concentrations of acetate
compared with lactate. The
predominant amino acids are
glutamate and proline, with
ammonia also found at significant
level. The presence of elevated
levels of acetate is due to the
accumulation of end products of
amino acid breakdown as well as
those of carbohydrate metabolism.
These metabolic products
are present at much higher
concentrations than in saliva.

Resting Lymphocytes Ig
is
expressed on cell surfaces when
they serve as membrane bound
receptors for specific antigen. It
may express tens of thousands of
membrane Ig. Also known as
virgin and B-Lymphocytes.

Restoration
is any replacement for
lost tooth structure or teeth i.e.
bridges, fillings, crowns and
implants.

Restorative dentistry
is a branch of
dentistry that deals with the
process of restoring missing,
damaged or diseased teeth to
normal form and function.

Resuscitation
is bringing back to
life.

Retained infantile swallowing
is a
swallowing pattern that is seen
due to persistent presence of this
swallowing reflect ever after
arrival of permanents teeth. The
tongue lies between the teeth in
front and on both sides,
particularly noticeably are the
contractions of the buccinator
muscle. In expressive faces the 7th
cranial nerve muscles are not
being used for the delicate
purpose of facial expression.
Modification often occurs
between the tongue tip and palate
because of the in adequately
occlusal contact.

Retainer
is a removable appliance
used to maintain teeth in a given
position. Retainer can be of 2 types
functional and non functional.

are the
markings in the surface of the
tooth that enhance placement and
retention of restoration.

episodes of unilateral transient
visual disturbance such as
prolonged visual blackout and
brainstem symptoms such as
vertigo, double vision and loss of
consciousness. Headache and
vomiting are usual.

elevated nodule located on lingual
mucosa of mandibular cuspid. It
is a soft, well circumscribed,
sessile, mucosal nodule. It is
bilateral and is common in
children. It regresses with age and
does not require any treatment.

Retrograde amnesia
refers to
failure to remember up to the
time of injury.

Retrograde pulpitis
is a condition
where the bacterial and the
inflammatory products of
periodontitis gain access to the
pulp via the accessory canals,
dentinal tubules or apical
foramina. The reverse effects of
necrotic pulp on periodontal
tissue is known as retrograde
pulpitis.

Retrusion
refers to movement of
the mandible posteriorly from
ICP (Intercuspal position).

Reverse smoking
is seen in coastal
communities of India. It causes
increased frequency of oral
lesions.

Reverse three–quarter crown
is
used on mandibular molars to
preserve on intact lingual surface.
It is useful on FPD (Fixed partial
dentures) abutments with severe
lingual inclination, preventing
destruction of large quantities of
tooth structure that could occur
if a full veneer crown were used.
The grooves at linguo proximal
line angles are pointed of an
occlusal offset on buccal slope of
lingual cusps. This preparation
closely resembles a maxillary
three fourth crown preparation
because axial surface of non
penetration cusp is uncovered.

Reversed architecture
is a bony
defect produced by the loss of
interdental bone that includes
facial and lingual plates,
reversing the normal architecture.

Reversible index
is a index that
measures conditions that can be
changed. Reversible index scores
can increase or decrease on
subsequent examinations, e.g.

recurrent systemic inflammatory
disease primarily involving the
joints. Begin in small joints of
hands and feet and progress in
centripetal and symmetric fashion.
Its exact cause is not known.
Onset is insidious with pain,
swelling and stiffness of joint.
Usually proximal interphalageal
joints are involved. It is polyarticular
and symmetrical. It
presents exacerbations and remissions.
T.M. Joint is not commonly
involved. Person develops fever,
loss of weight and fatigue. Movement
of jaw causes stiffness.
Clicking and snapping is not common.
It is also associated with
vasculitis, skin and muscle atrophy,
subcutaneous nodules, lymphadenopathy,
splenomegaly
and leucopenia. Hemorrhagic
infarcts in nail fold and finger

of cases. It is generally present as
subcutaneous or intracutaneous
nodule. These are discrete, firm,
non tender swellings on extensor
surfaces of fore arm. Wrist and
ankle are also involved. Some
nodules may even break.

Rhinophyma
is also known as
potato nose. There is painless and
slowly growing swelling of nose
of insidious onset. It may develop
due to longstanding rosacea but
may develop as a complication of
acne also. There develops
irregular thickening of nose.
Distal part of nose swells and
becomes irregular with many
shallow pits. Swelling is of bluish
red color and a few dilated
capillaries are seen. Hypertrophy
of nose leads to lobulated and
purplish vessels. Face, cheeks and
fore head may be affected.

Rhinosporidiosis
is caused by
rhinosporidium seeberi, a fungus.
Skin lesions are like wart with
peduncle. Oral lesions are soft,
red polypoid growth of a tumor
like nature which spread to the
pharynx. Lesion bleeds easily.
There is no specific treatment.

Riboflavin
is a yellow green
fluorescent compound soluble in
water. It is soluble in water being
part of vitamin B complex and is
decomposed by heat and on
exposure to light. Liver, meat,
milk, eggs are good source of it.
Cereals don’t remain rich source
as milling of grains remove it.
Daily dose is 1.7 mg in adult man.
Deficiency of it affects eyes and
nerves. Lips are cracked at corner
of mouth and tongue gets
swollen. Therapeutic dose is 5 mg.

is the disease occurring in
children due to the deficiency of
vitamin D. The infant with rickets
often receiving sufficient calories
may appear well nourished
but will be restless, fretful and
pale with flabby muscles. Sweating

tone.

Rigor mortis
starts after a gap of
two hours. Once body becomes
stiff it remains for 20 hours. It first
appears in involuntary muscles of
the heart and then spreads to the
voluntary group of muscles. It
develops due to coagulation of
muscle plasma and formation of
lactic acid. It develops early in
feeble, fatigued and exhausted
muscles in warm and moist air.

Ringworm lesion
is a fungal
infection. Lesions are red, annular
round, scaling which develops
suddenly. Ringworm lesion may
be single or if multiple may not
be symmetrical. Acute infective
disorder may be confused with
psoriasis.

when present,
increases the likelihood that an
individual will get a disease.
These factors include environmental,
behavioral and biologic
factors.

Risk indicators
are probable risk
factors that has been identified in
cross – sectional studies but not
confirmed by longitudinal studies.

Risk
is the probability, that an
individual will get a specific
disease in a given period of time.
The risk of developing a particular
disease varies from an
individual to individual.

Rodent ulcer
occurs due to basal
cell carcinoma. It is over face near
the medial canthus of eye. It is a
large, irregular having a well
defined, raised and beaded eye.
It is indurated. Regional lymph
nodes are not enlarged.

is the traditional unit of
exposure for X-rays, the quantity
of X-radiation that produces an
electrical charge of 2.58 × 10-4.

Romon syndrome

Rongeur forcep
is a nipper like
instrument to trim alveolar bone.

Root amputation
is to remove one
or more roots of a tooth.

Root canal files
are hand
instruments resembling reamers
and made in standard length but
in different width. Their job is to
smooth and clean the walls of
enlarged root canals and remove
debris. After inserting in canal
they are used in up and down
filing action against canal wall.
These are used in increasing sizes.

Root canal pluggers
are the
endodontic hand instruments that
have a long tapered smooth point.
Their aim is to fill any gap that is
existing. They have a long handle
with a small head.

Root canal obtruation
is to remove
inflamed or dead pulp from a
tooth and replace it with a insert,
sterile, non irritant, insoluble root
canal filling. It is generally done
in two stages. First is to prepare
the canal and second is to insert
the root filling. In first stage pulp
is removed then canal is enlarged
and cleaned to prepare a dry,
smooth empty canal tapering
from pulp chamber to apex. Then
temporary filling is done to cover
entrance of empty root canal. In
second stage temporary filling is
removed and if canal is clean and
dry it is filled to seal off the entire
canal to within a millimeters of an
apex.

Root canal reamers
are hard as well
as rotary instrument used to
enlarge the root canal. These are
having set length but different
width. Each one is numbered to
indicate its size. First small reamer
is inserted with hand rotation
with successively wider reamers
until canal becomes large enough
for filling.

Root canal therapy (RCT)
is a
clinical procedure used to save an
abscessed tooth in which the pulp
chamber is cleaned out, disinfected,
and filled with a permanent
filling.

Root caries index
is the epidemiological
index that is best choice for
evaluating caries prevalence in
the senior population of the
community. Old generation is
more prone to root caries.

Root forceps
have blades with
rounded ends. There are different
patterns available. Different
angles are made with handle.
Lower root forceps are used for
all lower teeth, straight forceps for
upper incisors and canine. Read
forceps for premolars and molar,
bayonet forceps for upper
premolars and molars.

Root picks
are surgical probes used
to remove root fragments which
may break away from tooth
during extraction. Various shapes
and sizes are available.

Rootless teeth
are very short and
conical. Pulp chambers are
obliterated by multiple nodules.

Root planing stroke
is a moderate
to light stroke used for planing or
final smoothening of root surface
or the removal of plaque
embedded calculus and altered
cementum from the roots of teeth.

Root trunk
is that portion of the
root that is not bifurcated or
trifurcated.

Rooting reflex and sucking reflex
is a reflex when the full term
infant sucks vigorously, when the
breast is brought into contact with
the infants cheeks, he/she seeks
the nipple. Stimulation of the
upper and lower lip produced
movements of the lip and tongue
in the direction of the stimulus.
Rooting reflex is weak, not
synchronized with swallowing at
28 weeks of gestation. It is
stronger and well synchronized at
32 week of intrauterine life.

Rotary scrub method of tooth brushing
is a method of tooth
brushing in which circular strokes
are used.

Rotatary paste fillers
are engine
instruments for inserting pastes
Rubber dam punch

into root canal. These consists of
spiral wire fitting into hand piece.
It propels the required material to
the full length of root canal.

Rothera’s test
10 ml of urine is
saturated with an excess of
ammonium sulphate crystals, 3
drops of strong freshly prepared
sodium nitroprusside and 2 ml of
strong ammonia solutions are
added. A deep permanganate
color is produced by acetone and
acetoacetic acid. Positive test
confirms presence of ketone
bodies.

Rubber cups
are the polishing
instruments which consist of a
rubber shell with or without
webbed configurations in the
hollow interior. They are placed
in handpiece with a special prophylaxis
angle.

Rubber dam punch
is used to
punch holes in the rubber dam to
be placed over tooth.

Rubella
is also known as German
measles. It is caused by RNA
virus of togavirus family. Child
of 3 to 10 years in mostly affected.
It is transmitted directly.
Incubation period is 2 to 3 weeks.
50% patients are asymptomatic.
There develops low grade fever
and lymphadenopathy. Rash is an
inconstant feature.

Rule of 5
is the simplest method for
calculation of TBSA (total body
surface area) is to subtract 1%
from head and neck and adding
1% to lower limb for every year
after 1 year of age. This charting
technique has been described by
Lund and Browder Rule of 5 has also
been used though infrequently.
According to this rule, the body
is divided into 20 areas of 5 % each
by dividing the body into coronal
and sagittal planes.

Rule of nine
is a frequently used
method to determine the extent of
burn injury. The body is divided
into 11 areas of 9% each to help
estimate the amount of skin
surface burned in an adult.

Rutherford syndrome
has
congenitally enlarged gingiva,
delayed tooth eruption and
superior corneal opacities that
have curtain like appearence
patient may be mental retarded,
aggressive behavior along with
dentigerous cysts.

S
refers to sella, the
midpoint of hypophyseal
fossa.

Saccharine
is an artificial
sweetener that is 500-600
times sweeter than sucrose,
is stable in aqueous
solution and is compatible
with most food and
drug ingredients. Its major disadvantage
is its metallic aftertaste.

Sacro iliac strain
is a hip joint pain
that may radiate to buttock, hip
and lateral aspect of thigh. There
may be tenderness over symphysis
pubis and person may limp.

Saddle angle (N-S-A)
is the angle
formed by joining these three
points providing a parameter for
assessment of the relationship
between anterior and posterior
lateral cranial bases. Thus a large
saddle angle usually signifies a
posterior condylar position and a
mandible that is posteriorly
positioned with respect to the
cranial base and maxilla.

Safe period
is the period of
menstrual cycle when conception
is least likely to result from
intercourse without use of
contraceptive device.

Sagittal plane
is an imaginary
longitudinal vertical plane that
divides the mouth into two halves
left and right.

Salad
is a roughage and best to start
a meal with fresh raw salad.
Common vegetables used for
salad are salad leaves, onions,
cucumber, green chillies, carrots
and turnip. All these contain
minerals and vitamin C. On
cooking these nutrients are being
lost hence should be used in raw
form but before consumption
these should be properly washed
in fresh water. Most of these
contain cellulose which is not
digested but does not allow
constipation to develop. Salad is
having negative calorific value.

Salicylate
is the widely used
analgesic and was first used in
medicine by Dreser in 1899. It is
an antipyretic, analgesic and anti
inflammatory drug. Pain is
relieved by peripheral and central
nervous system effect. It inhibits
the synthesis of prostaglandins
which occur in inflamed tissue. It
reduces the sensitization of pain
receptors to local stimuli.
Antipyretic effect only occurs
when temperature is above
normal. It dissipates body heat
also. It should not be used in cases
of G.I.T. Ulcer/acidity. It may
cause microscopic hemorrhage. It
may result in skin rashes, urticaria
and angioedema.

Saliva
is the glandular secretion,
which constantly bathes the teeth
and the oral mucosa. It is constituted
by the secretions of the three
paired major salivary glands, the
parotid, submandibular sublingual,
the minor salivary glands
and the gingival fluid. Saliva is
armed with various defense
mechanisms, such as the immunological,
enzymatic and other
organic and inorganic defense
system. In addition, saliva has the
ability to protect the mucosa
against mechanical insults and to
promote its healing via the activity
of the epidermal growth factors.
The involvement of the oral
tissues in diverse functions as
mastication and deglutition of
food, taste sensations, speech and
initial digestion of carbohydrates
would not be possible without
salivary secretions. The interface
between saliva and oral tissues is
the site of many dynamic reactions,
which affect the integrity of
both the soft and hard tissues of
the mouth. Saliva constitutes one
of the main natural defense systems
of the oral cavity. Salivary
organic, inorganic and physical
factors are indispensable for the
control of different oral microorganisms
and its product for the
maintenance of homeostasis in
the oral environment. The challenges
to homeostasis are met
with a variety of host defense
mechanisms. Several protective
barriers exist for the soft tissues
of the oral cavity. Bacterial penetration
of the oral mucosa is first
impeded by the salivary barrier.
This barrier confronts the bacteria
with a variety of antibody and
innate immune components (e.g.,
mucin, lactoferin, lysosome, lactoperoxidase)
that can mediate
protective effects in several ways.

Saliva ejactor
is connected to a low
velocity vacuum to remove saliva
from the patients mouth during
a dental procedure.

Salivary amylase
is a digestive
enzyme found in saliva that
begins chemical digestion of
carbohydrates.

Salivary duct stones
are the
calcareous concentrations in
salivary duct. There is severe pain
just before during and after meals.
There is no free flow of saliva.
Swelling is due to obstruction of
saliva. Occasionally stone present
may not show any symptoms.
Stone may measure from a few
mm to a cm. Small calculi may be
sometimes removed manually,
bigger stones require surgery.

Salivary hypofunction
results due
to three main causes,
dehydration, damage of salivary
glands or interference with the
neural transmission.

Salt and milk fluoridation
is a
method of providing systemic
fluoride by adding fluoride to salt
i.e. by spraying a concentrated
solution of NAF2 or KF on salt on
a conveyor belt, another method
is by adding premixed granules
of caf2 and Po4 to salt. Salt fluoridation
first started in Switzerland
in 1955 and subsequent tests
revealed a 20-25% decrease in
caries experienced by using salt
with 90 ppm of F. In 1967 Muhlensen
found that 300 mg f/kg salt
yielding 1.5 mg, Zeigler (1956)
first explored that possibility of
fluoridating milk. In 1959,
Inamura (Japan) reported a 33.3%
caries reduction in school
children served daily with milk
containing 2.5 mg F. In India since
there is no central milk supply
regulating this method caries
prevention would be a daunting
task. Moreover, socio-economic
religious and ethnic factors affect
the quantity of milk consumed.

Salt restricted diet
normal
consumption of 5 gm daily in salt
restricted diet only 2 gram of it is
permitted. Sodium restricted
diets are advised in congestive
cardiac failure. In renal disease it
reduces edema while in toxaemia
of pregnancy it prevents fluid
retention. During act and
cortisone therapy also it has to be
avoided. Person should avoid all
salted and canned vegetables,
pickles, salted butter, cheese and
salted nuts.

Sampling distribution
is a distribution
of sample formed by
drawing repeated sample from
the same population.

Sanguinarine
is an herbal root
extract of the plant Sanguinria
Canadensis; it is a mixture of
benzophenanthridine alkaloids.
Evidence from studies Loesche
(1976), Southard et al (1984), and
walker (1990) supports the claim
of its antibacterial properties,
anti-plaque effects, and antiinflammatory
activity. Sanguinary
can reduce the acid
producing ability and affect the
adherence of bacteria. Since it
contains alcohol (11.5%), it may
produce a burning sensation and
is contraindicated with the use of
Metronidazole/Tinidazole.

Sarcoid sialadenitis
in 5% cases
parotid is involved in 3rd or 4th
decade. There is bilateral, firm,
painless enlargement. Decreased
or absent salivation is present.
Biopsy helps in diagnosis.
Treatment is symptomatic.
Corticosteroids are effective.

Sarcoidosis
is a chronic
glaucomatous disease which
involves lymph nodes, lungs,
speech, seen in 2nd and 3rd
decade of life and more in blacks.
It is a disease of unknown cause.
It generally affects hilar
lymphadenopathy pulmonary
infiltration and skin. Symptoms
are not severe enough to cause an
alarm. Mild malaise and cough
may be clinical features. Oral
manifestations are sarcoid
granuloma, Sarcoid gingivitis,
gingival tissues are hyperplastic
with a granular appearance. They
are red in color and bleed on
probing. There is painless
enlargement. Lesions of lips are
manifested as small, popular
nodules or plaques on palate and
buccal mucosa. Lesions are bleb
like. Kviem-siltzbach test is an
important aid. Histopathologically,
connective tissue shows,
non caseating whores of epithelial
cells and multinucleated foreign
body type giant cells with
peripheral mononuclear cells. In
some cases, severe and rapid
periodontal destruction can
occur.

Satiety centers
stimulation of
lateral hypothalamus causes to
eat voraciously while stimulation
of ventromedial nuclei of
hypothalamus causes complete
satiety and person will refuse to
eat.

Scabies
is caused by sarcopties
scabie. Transmission is by direct
personal contact or through linen,
towels, etc. The most frequent
areas involved are interdigital
folds, penis, scrotum and
hypothenal eminence on genitalia.
Lesions are firm of 5 m.m. Red
nodules are noted. Intense
pruritus is worse at night. 1%
gamma benzene hydrochloride is
effective to skin for 12-24 hours. Re
application is required after 5-7
days to kill newly hatched nits.
Antihistamines may be given if
itching is more.

Scalds
are moist heat injuries
produced by application to the
body of a liquid at or near boiling
point or by steam. Scalds are not
as severe as burns and produce
hyperaemia or vesiculation.

Scaling
is the process of removal of
plaque and calculus from the
crown and root surfaces of the
teeth. Curettes and scalers are
used for this purpose.

Scaling stroke
is a powerful stroke
which can be used in a pull
motion to remove hard and
tenacious calculus.

Scammon’s growth curve
explains
that different tissue systems of the
body grow at different times and
rate. The four important tissue
systems that show characteristic
growth pattern are: lymphoid,
neural, general and genital. As the
graph indicates, the growth of
neural tissue is nearly complete
by 6 to 7 years of age. General
body tissue including muscle,
bone and viscera shape curve
with a definite slow rate of
growth, during childhood. There
is acceleration during puberty.
Lymphoid tissue proliferates far
beyond adult amount in late
childhood and then undergoes
involution. At the same time, the
growth of genital tissue is rapid
(see Figure on page 402).

Scarlet fever
is caused by
streptococcal organisms of beta
hemolytic type producing
erythrogenic toxin. It looks like
tonsillitis. Number of different
strains of streptococci produces
the disease. Incubation period is
3-5 days. Oral manifestation is
‘stomatitis scarlantina, mucosa of
palate is congested and throat
becomes red. Tonsils are swollen.
Tongue becomes strawberry.
Tongue shows coating, papillae
become edematous with small
red knobs. Later tip of tongue
becomes clean and then lateral
borders follow. At last tongue
becomes smooth and glistening.
No reliable prevention is feasible.

Scheffe test
multiple comparison
procedure.

Schistosomiasis
is caused by
schistosomiasis hematobium;
cercariae are the infective stage of
parasite. Adult worm reside in
portal vein and in bladder venous
plexuses. Hemorrhage can occur
due to erosion of blood vessels.
Urticaria, fever anaphylactic
reaction may be seen. Bladder
wall is calcified.

School water fluoridation
is an alternative
therapy in community
water fluoridation. The recommended
concentration is 4-5 ppm.
It is shown to reduce caries experienced
by 40%. The disadvantage
is that children start receiving the
advantage of fluorides only when
they start school.

Schwannoma
is a slowly enlarging
lesion that is derived from
Schwann cells. Intraorally,
dorsum of tongue is most
favoured location. Buccal mucosa
floor of mouth, gingiva, and lips
can also be involved. It is painless,
nodule of different size. Sometime
small, lobulated, firm
growth may occur in gingiva. It
has a true capsule. Surgical
excision is the line of treatment
(see Figure on page 404).

Schwartz periotrievers
are the set
of two double ended, highly
magnetized instruments that are
designed for retrieval of periodontal
instrument from the deep
periodontal pockets and the
furcation areas.

Scientific misconduct
is fabrication,
calsification and other
defilations from accepted practice
in carrying out of reporting
results from research.

Scissors and nippers
are the
surgical instruments which are
used for removing tissues,
trimming of flaps, enlarging the
incisions and for removing
muscle attachments.

Scleroderma/progressive systemic sclerosis
is a disease of unknown
cause characterized by an
increased collagen deposition in
skin.

Sclerotic bone
is a well defined
radio opacity seen below the
apices of vital non carious teeth.

Sclerotic cemental masses
are
multiple, symmetric lesions
producing pain and localized
expansion.

Scope of Pedodontics
refers to the
range of activities or range of
therapeutic treatment to be
considered in a pediatric dental
practice.

Scot Sanchis method
is used for
estimation of fluoride in water.
This fluoride estimation test is
based on the reaction between the
fluoride and the red zirconium
alizarin. The fluoride forms a
colorless complex ion (Zr f6) and
liberates free alizarin sulphuric
acid, which is yellow in acid
solution. As the amount of
fluoride increases, the color
produced varies from yellow to
red. The fluoride level in the test
material is determined by
comparing the color thus
produced with the standards.

Scott’s hypothesis (cartilaginous theory)
cartilage grows actively,
bone later replaces it. Thus
cartilage has innate growth
potential. Transplantation and
extripation experiments prove
that some innate potential is
evident though results are
equivocal. e.g. mandibular
growth has been explained that
the condyle act as diaphysis of a
long bone with growth occurring
at both ends. Recent studies have
proven that growth at the condyle
is mostly reactive and not of
primary nature and maxillary
growth can be explained due to
translation of nasomaxillary
complex as a unit.

Scratched film
is a film handling
error. A scratched film is showing
white lines from which emulsion
has been removed by a sharp
object.

Scrotal tongue
also known as
fissured tongue. It shows many
small furrows on dorsal surface.
It is a painless condition unless
infected material is lodged in
fissures.

Scurvy
is a condition that occurs
due to long term deficiency of
vitamin C. Children between the
age of 4 and 18 months are
affected. Bleeding gums and
hematuria may be presenting
symptom. Cartilage cells don’t
proliferate at normal rate.
Radiographs will show osteopenia,
white line of Frankel,
Winberger sign and Pelken’s
spur.

Se
is the midpoint of the line
connecting the posterior clinical
process and anterior opening of
the sella turcica.

Sealant
is the application of a clear
resin over the biting surfaces of
teeth to prevent decay.

Sebaceous cysts of breast
are not
uncommon in skin covering
breast. These can develop at
periphery of areola. These can
become quite large, tender and
inflamed and are difficult to treat.
Incision and drainage is needed.

Sebaceous glands
are associated
with hair follicles. These secrete
an oily substance called sebum.
Sebum lubricates and helps water
proof hair and skin. Sebum
inhibits the growth of bacteria on
surface of skin. It inhibits the
growth of bacteria.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis
is an
inflammatory scaling disease of
scalp and face in general.
Composition of sebum remains
normal. Onset in adults in
gradual and dermatitis is
apparent only as dry. There may
be diffuse greasy scaling of scalp.
Marginal blephritis and dry
yellow crusts and conjuctival
irritation may be present. It does
not cause hair loss. Seborrhoeic
dermatitis is common at all ages.
Flexures of face are mostly
involved. Rash is red and scaly, a
few papules and pustules may
develop.

Second branchial arch
gives rise to
the cartilage of the second or
hyoid arch (Reicherts cartilage)
appearing at the 45th – 48th days.
Reichert’s cartilage attaches to the
basicranial optic capsule, where
it is grooved by the facial nerve.
It provides the remaining
cartilaginous circumference to the
labyrinthine and tympanic
segments of the facial canal. The
muscles of the hyoid arch
subdivide and migrate extensively
to form the stapedius, the
stylohyoid, posterior belly of
digastric, the mimetic muscle of
the face and levator velipalatine
muscle. All of these are
innervated by the seventh cranial
or facial nerve, serving the second
arch. The path of migration of
these muscles is traced out in the
adult by the distribution of
branches of facial nerve. The
special sensory component of is
nerve for taste, known as Chorda
tympani nerve, invades the first
arch as a pretrematic nerve and
thus comes to supply the mucosa
of the anterior two thirds of the
tongue. The artery of this arch
forms the stapedial artery which
disappears during the fetal period
leaving the foramen in the stapes.
The Stapedial artery, derived
from the second aortic arch, is
significant in the development of
the stapes ear ossicles. The
Stapedial blastoma grows around
the stapedial arch forming a ring
around the centrally placed
artery. The mid portion of the
stapedial artery involutes, leaving
the foramen in the stapes.
Stapedial arterial branches
persists, to become part of the
internal carotid artery proximally
and the external carotid artery
distally.

Second degree burns
are those
which involve epidermis and
varying depths of dermis. These
have been further divided into
superficial and deep second
degree burns (see Figure).

Second pharyngeal pouch
the
ventral portion of this pouch is
obliterated by the developing
tongue. The dorsal portion of this
pouch persists in an attenuated
form as the tonsillar fossa, the
endodermal lining of which
covers the underlying mesodermal
lymphatic tissue to form the
palatine tonsil.

Second transitional period
is
characterized by the replacement
of the deciduous molars and
canines by the premolars and the
permanent canines respectively.
The combined mesiodistal width
of the permanent canines and
premolars is usually less than that
of the deciduous canines and
molars. The surplus space is
called leeway space of Nance. The
amount of leeway space is greater
in the mandibular arch than in the
maxillary arch. It is about 1.8 mm
(0.9 mm on each side of the arch)
in the maxillary arch and about
3.4 mm (1.7 mm on each side of
the arch) in the mandibular arch.
This excess space available after
the exchange of the deciduous
molars and canines is utilized for
mesial drift of the mandibular
molars to establish Class I molar
relation.

Secondary dentin
refers to a
dentine that is formed after the
deposition of primary dentin.
Physiologically it happens in old
age. Pathologically it results from
abnormal irritation. It develops
due to dental caries, abrasion,
attrition and erosion. Dentin
forms an additional insulting
layer of calcified tissue between
the pulp and the pathological
process. On X-ray size of pulp is
decreased.

Secondary displacement
is said to
have occurred when movement
of the bone is not directly related
to its own enlargement. For
example anterior direction of
growth by the middle cranial
fossa and the temporal lobe of the
cerebrum displace the maxilla
anteriorly and inferiorly.

Secondary effects
are related to
drug administration but not
directly attributable to drug
action. For example during broad
spectrum antibiotic therapy super
infection with Candida Albicans
may cause thrush.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism
can be seen in rickets, osteomalacia
and chronic renal failure.
Brown tumors are less frequently
seen. Calcification of arteries and
soft tissue occurs.

Secondary lymphoid organs
are
those that include the lymph
nodes, spleen, and MALT:
mucosa associated lymphoid
tissue e.g. tonsils. GALT: gut
associated lymphoid tissue e.g.:
payers’ patch. SALT: skin
associated lymphoid tissue. These
organs create an environment
where lymphocytes can interact
with each other and with antigen
and disseminate the immune
response once generated.

Secondary polycythemia
is said to
have occured when number of
RBCs increases due to decreased
oxygen. Decreased oxygen in
blood triggers an increase in
erythropoietin by kidneys which
results in increase in RBCs.
Pulmonary disease, high altitude
and elevation of carbon monoxide
may cause it.

Secondary prevention
includes
techniques designed to terminate
disease and restore tissues to near
normal function. Secondary
prevention is done to diagnose
the proliferation of a disease in its
early stages and retard or stop the
progress so that the damage is
minimized and the subsequent
repair is facilitated.

Secondary spacing
was initially
described by Baume, 1950. In
closed dentitions the permanent
mandibular lateral incisors
emerge and the primary mandibular
canines are moved laterally.
Thus a space is created that
cause the permanent maxillary
lateral incisors to emerge into a
favorable alignment.

Secondary syphilis
usually
appears in about 6-8 weeks after
the appearance of primary
chancre. It is characterized by skin
and mucosal lesions. There will be
generalized lymphadenopathy.
Skin lesions may be macular,
papular, follicular or lenticular.
Coin like lesions are common on
face. Areas of hyper pigmentation
can be seen on soles and palms.
Lymph nodes are painless,
discrete and not fixed to the
surroundings. With or even
without treatment lesions heal in
2-4 weeks.

Secondary syphilitic oral ulcer
appears in 3-12 weeks after primary
lesion. Oral lesions are
rarely seen without rash appearing.
Ulcers are painless. Palate,
tongue and lips may be affected.
Shape is flat and irregular ulcer
covered by grey membrane. They
coalesce to form rounded areas
known as mucus patches. Person
will have fever and malaise. There
may be skin rash on palms and
ulcers are serologically positive
and highly infective.

Secondary trauma from occlusion
is said to have occurred when the
adaptive capacity of the tissues to
withstand occlusal forces is
impaired due to bone loss.

Sedation
refers to allaying stress,
irritability, excitement or calming
a person with the help of drugs.

Selected polishing
refers to
polishing only those teeth
affected with stain and plaque.

Selectin
is a class of adhesion proteins
that recognize specific oligosaccharide
residues displayed
on cell surface glycoprotein’s
called mucin.

Selectin mediated phase
is a phase
where the neutrophils collides
with vessel wall, allowing P
selectin and E selectin molecules
on activated endothelial cells to
bind neutrophil surface mucin. Lselectin
which is expressed on
neutrophil, bind to its own set of
target mucin on endothelial cell
surface. These three types of
selection establish initial adhesive
contact between neutrophil and
vessel wall. Selectin and mucous
ligands are elongated molecules
located at the tip of microvillus.
Selectin bind tightly to their
ligands in less than a millisecond
so that even momentary contact
can tether a moving neutrophil
firmly to the wall. Neutrophil
continues to roll or skip
intermittently along vessel wall
due the force of the following
blood. The rolling exposes
neutrophil to a diverse group of
substance leucocytic chemotactic
factor expressed by activated
endothelium or diffuse into blood
from injured tissue.

Selective anesthesia
is given to
know which tooth is paining. If
specific tooth is involved pain will
disappear on anesthesia.

Semi critical instruments
are those
that remain in contact of oral
tissues like mirror, plastic
instruments, burr etc. These
should be sterilized after each use.
Some may be kept in disinfective
solutions for 6-10 hours.

Semicircular fibres
are the group
of fibres which are attached at the
proximal surface of tooth below
the CEJ, go around the facial or
lingual margins of the tooth and
attach on the other proximal
surface.

Semiconductor lasers
sometimes
called diode lasers, are not solidstate
lasers. These electronic
devices are generally very small
and use low power. They may be
built into larger arrays, such as the
writing source in some laser
printers or CD players.

Semi-longitudinal method
means
monitoring age-groups or sub
groups at different level of
development only for a period
which separates one group from
the next.

Senile caries
are those that occur
during old age. This may be due
to reduction in salivary secretion
or exposure of roots following
gingival recession.

Senile cataract
occurs due to
ageing. There will be gradual
impairment of vision. In
immature cataract lens appears
greyish, iris shadow is present.
Finger counting at a short
distance may be present. In
mature cataract lens appears
partly white and iris shadow is
absent. The vision is reduced to
perception of hand movement.
There is no red fundal glow when
examined in dark room.

Senile gait
in old age looses speed
and balance. Gait is slow, stiff
with decrease in length of stride.
Skeletal deformity and joint
abnormality affects gait.

Sensory ataxia lesions
occur in
posterior column of spinal cord,
posterior roots or peripheral
nerves causes sensory ataxia.
Patient clears the ground
abruptly. He walks in a flexed
posture. Romberger sign is
positive. It is seen in subacute
combined degeneration and
spinal cord compression.

Sensory interaction theory
contended that pain result from
the interaction of both nociceptive
and non-nociceptive afferent
fibers on central neurons, the
resulting excitatory or inhibitory
interactions determining whether
or not pain was perceived.

Septic arthritis of TMJ
commonly
results from blood borne bacterial
infection. It may involve joint by
direct trauma or infection may
extend from infection of maxillary
sinus or parotid.

Sequestrum
is a piece of necrosed
bone that has become separated
from the surrounding as seen in
chronic osteomyelitis.

Serial extraction
is an interceptive
orthodontic procedure usually
initiated in early mixed dentition
when one can recognize and
anticipate potential irregularities
in the dentofacial complex and is
corrected by a procedure that
includes the planned extraction of
certain deciduous teeth and later
specific permanent teeth in an
orderly sequence and predetermined
pattern to guide the
erupting permanent teeth into a
more favorable position.

Serotonin
is associated with
vascular pain syndromes as an
algogenic agent, an important
endogenous anti-nociceptive
mechanism.

Setting time
is the time calculated
from the very beginning of mixing
of the cement the formation
of a hard and rigid cement.

Severe internal hemorrhage
can be
manifested when the patient
becomes pale and restless. Patient
may develop thirst and visual
black outs. Skin becomes cold and
moist. Pulse becomes thready and
rapid. Body temperature comes
down and B.P. Falls. Subcutaneous
vein collapse and it becomes
difficult to locate vein.

Severe periodontitis
is said to have
occurred when the periodontal
destruction is generally considered
severe when 5 mm of clinical
attachment loss has occurred.

Sex drive
is the primary instinctual
urge of sexual gratification. It
reaches its peak in late teens in
males and mid thirties among
females. In contrast of animals the
human sex drive is less seasonal,
less dependent upon an oestreous
cycle, more varied in expression
and aroused by a wide range of
stimuli.

Sexual apathy
is a negative attitude
towards sexual relations, ranging
from indifference to listlessness to
active repulsion. Apathy is often
based on distasteful or painful
experiences and monotonous and
unimaginative approach of the
partner.

Sexual ecstasy
is the peak of
pleasure, excitement and
euphoria experienced at the
moment of orgasm.

Sexual flush
is the rushing of blood
during sexual excitement, especially
in women. Flushing begins
with rash like discoloration of
lower chest and spreads to breast,
rest of chest, neck, reaching a peak
during the late plateau phase.

Shade card
is an assortment of
number coded shade samples
used to match a patient’s tooth
coloring for an esthetic crown.

Shape memory
is a property of
certain wires that will permit
shaping at a higher temperature,
followed by deformation at a
lower temperature and a return
to the original shape by reheating.

Sharpey’s fibers
can be described
as a terminal portion of principal
fibers that gets inserted into
cementum and bone.

Shelf life
is the period of time
during which a compound retains
its useful characteristics.

Shell teeth
There is thin shell of
hard dental tissue surrounding
overlap pulp chamber. Pulp
consists of coarse connective
tissue.

Shigellosis
is caused by Shigella
Sonnei. Illness starts abruptly
with abdominal cramps and
diarrhea. Fever, chill, loss of
appetite and headache develops.
Patient becomes more dehydrated.
Abdomen is tender. Stool
culture is positive. Stool will
contain red cells and leucocytes.

Shovel shaped incisors
is a
developmental anomaly where
affected incisors demonstrate
prominent lateral margins
creating a hollowed lingual
surface resembling shovel. Typically
the thickened marginal
ridges converge at the cingulum,
not uncommonly there is a deep
pit or dens invaginatus at this
junction. Maxillary incisors are
more commonly affected.

Shunt
is to divert from one location
to another.

Sialadenosis
is a non neoplastic,
non inflammatory enlargement of
salivary gland. There develops
recurrent, painless enlargement.
Parotid glands are affected. There
is significant elevation of salivary
potassium and decrease in
sodium in saliva is seen.

Sialolithiasis
results in painful
intermittent swelling in area of a
major salivary gland. Pain
worsens while eating food. Stasis
of saliva leads to infection, fibrosis
and atrophy of parenchyma.
Sialography remains the best
method to diagnose. Acute
infections secondary to stasis
should be treated with antibiotics.

Sickle cell anemia
is a hereditary
type of chronic hemolytic anemia.
It is more common in females. On
dental X-rays mild to moderate
osteoporosis is seen. Trabecular
change is prominent in alveolar
bone. Hair on end appearance of
skull may develop. Outer table
appears absent and diploe
thickened. Hemoglobin level is
decreased. No specific treatment
is available except blood
transfusion. One may live a
normal life span.

Sickle scalers
are the hand instruments
used to remove plaque,
supragingival calculus from the
crown of the tooth. These scalers
are bulky with a flat surface and
two cutting edges that converge
to form a pointed tip. The tip is
used primarily to remove the
hard deposits present on the
crown.

Side effects
are those unwanted
effects that are due to normal
pharmacological actions of drug.

Sigmoid volvulus
exhibits generalized
lower abdominal distension.
X-ray will show a greatly
distended loop of bowel. There is
loss of haustral markings. On
barium enema a bird’s beak
deformity with spiral narrowing
of the upper end of lower segment
is pathogomonic. Laparotomy
is the ultimate answer.

Significant caries index
A new
index, the significant caries index
was introduced by Bratthall (2000)
in order to bring attention to the
individuals with the highest caries
values in each population under
investigation. The significant
caries index is calculated as
follows: individuals are sorted
according to their DMFT values,
one third of the population with
the highest caries scores is selected,
and the mean DMFT for this
subgroup is calculated. This value
is the SCI index.

Signs
are the effects of disease
noticed by doctor.

Signs of abortion
signs of recent
delivery are found. There will be
bloody discharge from the dilated
vagina. There may be excoriations
or lacerations in the mucus
membrane and uterus may be
enlarged.

Silent primary pain
may be inhibited
unless is felt by patient. Thus
leaves the secondary referred
pain as his main complaint.

Silicate cement
is mostly used even
being extremely injurious filling
material. It is used in restoration
of proximal cavities of anterior
teeth. Phosphoric acid is an
injurious agent in silicate cement.

Silicon rubber
is a polymer
resulting from the formation of
silicon–oxygen–silicon bonds.

Silver + copper amalgams
are
currently in clinical use because
of their resistance to corrosion
and their higher creep. At 5 weeks
they elicited only slight response.

Silver permanent pigmentation of skin and mucus membrane
is due
to reduction in silver compound
in tissues. Pigmentation of oral
mucus membrane is diffusely
dispersed in oral cavity.

are involving
only one surface of the tooth.

Simple fracture
refers to the closed
linear fracture.

Simple index
is the index that
measures the presence or absence
of a condition.

Simple tongue thrust
is a thrust
with a malocclusion which
demonstrates a well
circumscribed anterior open bite
and posterior teeth in a stable
inter digitations. Associated with
a digit habit may persist after the
digit habit has subsided. Once the
malocclusion is resolved, the
tongue will usually change its
swallow pattern and adapt to a
new tooth alignment. Complex
tongue thrust occurs with a teeth
apart. There is generalized open
bite and poor posterior occlusal
fit and during swallowing,
contraction of the lip, Mentalis
and facial musculature,
mandibular and maxillary teeth
not in contact and the tongue held
between the teeth. It is often
associated with chronic airway
problems such as mouth
breathing, tonsillitis, pharyngitis
or nasorespiratory distress.

Simplified fluoride mottling index (FMI)
was introduced by
Rahmatulla M and Rajasekhar A
in 1984. The FMI is based on
enamel opacities/lesions present
on facial surfaces of the six upper
and lower anterior teeth, which
are aesthetically important. The
scoring is based on a hypoplastic
facial surface which may range
from opaque white spots to grayish-
yellow discolored surfaces.
The weighting score assigned is
restricted to four.

Simplified indices
are those
indices which measure only a
representative sample of the
dental apparatus. e.g. Greene and
vermillion’s oral hygiene indexsimplified
(OHI-S).

Simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S)
proposed by Greene and
Vermillion in 1964 as a modification
of the OHI. Assess oral
cleanliness by estimating the
tooth surface covered with debris
or calculus. The OHI-S has two
components, the simplified debris
index and the simplified calculus
index. The two scores may be
used separately or may be
combined for the OHI-S.

Single visit endodontic therapy
is
defined as the conservative, non
surgical treatment of an
endodontically involved tooth
consisting of complete biomechanical
preparation and obturation
of the root canal system in one
visit.

Sinter consolidating particles
produce a more dense agglomerate
without melting. It takes place
during manufacture and during
heating to drive off impurities.

Sintering
is a densification process
in which solid particles are fused
together at high temperature.

Sinusitis
is a generalized inflammation
of paranasal sinuse’s
mucosa. Cause may be allergic,
viral or bacterial. It causes
blockage of drainage and thus
retention of sinus secretion. It
may be caused by extension of
dental infection. Sinusitis is
divided into three types: Acute
sinusitis is of less than two weeks,
Subacute sinusitis is up to three
months, Chronic is when it exists
for more than three months.
Clinical features include common
cold, nasal discharge, allergic
rhinitis, pain and tenderness over
the sinus involved. Pain may be
referred to premolar and molar
teeth with fever, chills and
malaise. Secretions reduce air and
make sinus radiopaque, mucosal
thickening at floor and later on
may involve whole sinus.
Thickened mucosa may be
uniform or polypoid, air fluid
level may also be present due to
accumulation of secretions. It is
horizontal and straight. Chronic
sinusitis may result in opacification
of sinus.

Sixth branchial arch
the cartilage
of this arch probably forms the
cricoid and aryteriod cartilages of
the larynx. The mesoderm forms
the intrinsic muscles of the larynx,
which are supplied by the nerve
of the arch, the recurrent
laryngeal branch of the tenth
cranial i.e. vagus nerve. The nerve
of this arch passes caudal to the
fourth arch artery in its recurring
path from the brain to the muscles
it supplies, the differing fate of the
left and right fourth arch arteries,
when migrating caudally into the
thorax accounts for the different
recurrent paths of the left and
right laryngeal nerve. The right
recurrent laryngeal nerve
recurves around the aorta (fourth
arch artery) the dorsal part of the
sixth aortic artery and the entire
fifth aortic artery having
disappeared. The sixth arch
arteries develop in part into the
pulmonary arteries. The remainder
disappears on the right side
and forming on the left side of the
temporary ductus arteriosus of
the fetal circulation that becomes
the ligamentum arteriosum.

Sjögren’s syndrome
is a triad
consisting of keratoconjunctivitis
sicca, xerostomia and rheumatoid
arthritis. It is an autoimmune
disorder of exocrine glands which
may be associated with
neuropathy and lymph
proliferative disorder. Histological
hallmark is focal lymphocytic
infiltration of exocrine glands.
Epstein – Barr or a type a
retrovirus is the causative
organism. Xerostomia is a major
complaint in most patients with
parotid gland enlargement.
Enlargement of submandibular
gland may be there. There may be
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
Kidney involvement is noted.
Generally women are affected
above the age of 40. Hypofunction
of salivary and lacrimal glands,
dryness of mouth and eyes is seen.
There will be intense lymphocytic
infiltration of gland or there may
be atrophy of gland. There is no
satisfactory treatment.

Sjögren’s syndrome tongue
is
typically red with atrophied
papillae. Dorsum becomes
lobulated with a cobblestone
appearance. Amount of saliva is
reduced.

Skewed distribution
is not
symmetrical. It is with a long tail
at its upper or lower end.

Skin
is the outermost covering of
the human body. It has two
layers. An outer layer called
epidermis and an inner layer is
dermis. Epidermis has five layers.
The stratum germianativum is the
layer in which cell division takes
place. New cell produce keratin
and die and are pushed towards
surface. Dermis is the true skin. It
lies on subcutaneous tissue. Color
of skin depends on amount of
melanin.

Skin nasion
is the point of
maximum convexity between the
nose and forehead.

Sleep apnea
are bouts of breathing
cessation during sleep due to
closing of upper airway associated
with obesity due to deposition
of fat.

Sleep
is a periodical physiological
depression of function of parts of
brain controlling consciousness.
As sleep deepens there is a transition
from normal alpha waves
to a phase of bursts of more rapid
wave and then development of
slow random waves. It is known
as non REM sleep. It has four
stages. Insomnia in elderly is associated
with awakenings and
with a reduced proportion of
paradoxical sleep. Pulse rate, B.P.
and respiratory rate falls.

Sleep paralysis
is a condition in
which the patient when falling
asleep or more often on walking
find himself unable to move a
muscle.

Slight periodontitis
is said to have
occurred when the periodontal
destruction is 1 to 2 mm of clinical
attachment.

S-line or Steiner line
is a line drawn
from soft-tissue pogonion to the
midpoint of the s-shaped curve
between subnasale and nasal tip.
Lips lying behind this reference
line are too flat and those lying
anterior to it are too prominent.

Sling ligation
is the suture used for
flaps on one surface of the tooth
that involves two interdental
spaces.

Slough
is a mass of dead tissue.

Slow rising pulse
is an arterial
pulse in aortic stenosis. The pulse
is of small volume with a late
systolic peak. There is a drill in
carotid pulse.

SLS (superior labial sulcus)
is the
point of greatest concavity in the
midline of the upper lip between
subnasale and labrale superius.

Slurry
is a mixture of pumice and
water used to remove plaque and
debris from crown of tooth.

Small bench top automatic autoclaves
are sterlizing instruments
and are very popular in dentistry.
In it there is down ward displacement
of air because steam enters
at the top of chamber. It requires
136° C at 32 pound pressure for 5
minutes.

Smoke tar
is a brownish liquid
which is obtained when tobacco
smoke is cooled or condensed. It
contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
compounds. Actually
these are produced as a result of
incomplete combustion of tobacco.
When the cigarette of 85 mm
length is smoked, having a butt of
30 mm. Total quantity of tobacco
smoke or effluent formed is about
500 mg in weight. Tobacco tar
formed is 17-40 mg by weight. Dry
tobacco gives more tar than tobacco
containing moisture.

Smoker’s melanosis
is diffuse
macular melanosis of the buccal
mucosa, lateral tongue, palate and
floor of the mouth noted in
smokers. Lesions are brown, flat
and irregular/map like configuration.

Smoker’s palate
is a specific lesion
which develops on palate in
heavy cigarette, pipe and cigar
smokers. Lesions are more
prominent on keratinized hard
palate. To start mucosa is red but
later on becomes greyish white,
fissured and thickened. Histologically
epithelium shows acanthosis
and hyper keratosis.

Smoker’s throat
there are number
of constituents in tobacco smoke
in sufficient concentration to
produce irritation to throat. The
delicate mucous membrane
becomes inflamed which induces
cough of a persistent nature. As
long as person smokes his cough
persists.

Smooth surface caries
is the carious
lesion located on surface other
than pits and fissures classified as,
smooth surface lesions. Smooth
surface lesions may be further
subdivided as inter-proximal,
occurring on mesial or distal
contact points, cervical, occurring
on buccal or lingual surface near
the dentine-enamel junction.

Sn (subnasale)
is the point at which
the columella (nasal septum)
merges with the upper lip in the
midsagittal plane.

SNA (sella-nasion-point A)
is the
angle expressing the sagittal
relationship of the anterior limit
of the maxillary apical base to the
anterior cranial base. It is large in
prognathic maxilla and small in
retruded maxillas. In class ii
division 1 malocclusion caused by
prognathic maxilla in which SNA
angle is larger than normal, the
use of an activator is contraindicated.
Mc Namara (1981) in his
study stated that the SNA angle
does not vary much among the
different types of malocclusion
nor does it change much with
functional appliance treatment.
The growth increments are small
for this criterion, and the
difference between growth direction
and types is insignificant.

Snake venom
is highly concentrated
digestive juice of snake.
Venom on drying forms fine
needle like crystals which are
easily soluble in water. Its toxic
properties are due to proteolytic
enzyme. Phosphatidase causes
hemolysis and toxic effect on
heart and circulation. There is
hemorrhage from lungs due to
damage of capillary endothelium.
Neurotoxin produces curare like
effects as well as paralysis.

SNB (sella-nasion-point B)
expresses the sagittal relationship
between the anterior extent of the
mandibular apical base and
anterior cranial base. With a
prognathic mandible it is large,
and with a retrognathic mandible
it is small. Functional appliance
treatment is indicated if the
mandible is retrognathic and has
a small SNB. This angle provides
information only on the
anteroposterior direction of the
mandible, not on its morphology
or growth direction. A posteriorly
located mandible can be large or
small, if it is small the prognosis
for anterior posturing in the
mixed dentition is good because
a larger growth increment can
usually be expected.

Snow capped teeth
is a type of
amelogenesis imperfecta, inherited
defect in enamel matrix
opposition and characterized by
teeth having normal enamel
thickness but low value of
radiodensity and mineral content.
The problem is related to the
persistence of organic content in
rod sheath resulting in poor
calcification, low mineral content
and a porous surface that
becomes stained. Defect is due to
altered matrix apposition (or)
large amount of poorly calcified
enamel matrix, which result in
enamel, which is relatively soft
becomes discolored. Enamel is
soft and vulnerable to attrition.
Hard tissue is neither structurally
weakened nor more susceptible
than normal tooth structure to
caries. It manifests as a white,
chalky, opaque discoloration of
the incisal and occlusal 3rd of the
crown. The opaqueness may be
solid or freckled, appears to
involve only the surface of the
enamel. The junction of the
opaque white and translucent
enamel is very sharp. The pattern
of affected teeth has a distinct
anteroposterior relationship and
does not correlate with chronologic
order of tooth development.

Social learning theory
was given
by Bandura in the year 1963.
Social learning theory is thought
to be the most complete. It is
clinically useful and theoretically
a sophisticated form of behavior
therapy. Advantages include less
reductionist, provides more
explanatory concepts, encompasses
a broader range of
phenomena. The learning of
behavior is affected by 4 principle
elements. Antecedent
determinants: the conditioning is
affected if the person is aware of
what is occurring. Consequent
determinants. Person’s perception
and expectances (cognitive
factors) determine behavior.
Modelling: learning through
observation eliminates the trial –
error search. It is not an automatic
process but requires cognitive
factors and involves 4 processes
which are- Attentional processes,
retention processes, reproduction
processes, Self – regulation: this
system involves a process of selfregulation
judgment and
evaluation of individual’s responses
to his own behavior.

Socket wall
can be described as
dense, lamellated bone which is
partially arranged in the
Haversian system and partially in
bundle bone.

Sodium hypochlorite
is an
excellent disinfectant and is
bactericidal. It is corrosive to
aluminium, nickel, steel and other
metals. Items may be disinfected
for 20 minutes. Gloves can be
disinfected thoroughly by rinsing
gloved hands and then rinsing
with soap and water.

Sodium
our body contains 70-80
grams of it. Over 1/3rd of this
amount is in skeleton. Enamel ash
contains 0.3%. It plays an
important role in maintenance of
acid base equilibrium. When
tissues are lacking potassium,
sodium may substitute for it. It
regulates the heart’s contraction.
5 gram is the daily requirement.
Heart patient should take 2 gm/
daily ideally. In hot season sweat
may contain 2 to 3 gm of salt per
litre. Kidney is the organ to
excrete it.

Sodium valporate
is an anti
epileptic drug controls petit mal
epilepsy and psychomotor
epilepsy. Patient becomes more
alert. It generally doesn’t produce
side effects.

Soft acrylic liners
its advantages
include high peel strength to
acrylic denture base and high
rupture strength. It has reasonable
resistance to damage by
cleaness. Disadvantage of it is of
poor resilience and some buckle
in water.

Soft drinks
are carbonated drinks
that exceed in food calories. A 300
ml of soft drink will contain about
140 calories. Each bottle contains
about 6 teaspoon full of sugars.
Most of the soft drinks contain
sodium which increases the
requirement of water. Sodas
contain hardly any calories.

Soft lasers
are thermal low energy
lasers emitted at wave length,
which are supposed to stimulate
cellular activity.

Soft liner
is a soft polymer used as
a thin layer on tissue bearing
surface of a denture.

Soft palate
is a posterior tissue
portion of the roof of the mouth.

Soft tissue cysts
are commonly
occurring masses in musculoskeletal
system. On MRI these
show uniform low and high
signal on T1 and T2W1.

Soft tissue sarcoma
arises from
mesenchymal tissue. Many soft
tissue sarcomas are poorly
differentiated. These include
malignant fibrous histiocytoma,
liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.
Large rheterogeneous
painless mass with in a deep
compartment should be regarded
with a high suspicion of malignancy
(see Figure on page 419).

Solar cheilitis
can result in
degeneration of tissue of lips due
to sun exposure. Condition is
related to the total cumulative
exposure to sunlight and amount
of skin pigmentation. Lower lip
is generally involved. Vermillion
border of lip is affected and not
specific treatment is required.

Soldering
is a laboratory procedure
done to join together with
the help of solder. Larger fixed
partial dentures are frequently
cast in parts and later on are soldered
together. Surfaces to be
joined should be without contamination.
A metal or alloy with
lower melting point should be
brought to the solder’s melting
temperature. Then ports and
shoulder is being brought to the
solder’s melting temperature. If
molten metal wets the solid metal
it will spread between the flux
and the metal part providing
good contact. Solder penetrates
joints by capillary action.

Solid-state lasers
have lasing
material distributed in a sold matrix
(such as the ruby or neodymium:
yttrium-aluminium garnet “Yag”
lasers). The neodymium-yag laser
emits infrared light at 1,064
nanometers (nm).

Soluble insulin
is standardized to
contain 20, 40 per ml. It is
normally given at subcutaneous
route and full effects come in 2-3
hours. Duration of action is 5-8
hours.

Somatic
is the nerve that supplies
muscles.

Somatic pain
often reflects a
pathological lesion in a specific
organ or tissue.

Sonicare
is an electric toothbrush.
It vibrates at over 31,000 brush
strokes per minute. Most models
offer a 3-minute timer.

Sorbitol
is a sugar alcohol made
from glucose. These also give
4 calories per gram as sucrose but
don’t promote cavities because
these are not easily metabolised
by bacteria in mouth. Sorbitol was
isolated in 1872; sorbitol is mainly
used in chewing gum. Intraoral
trials have indicated that plaque
pH does not drop below 5.7 after
chewing sorbitol sweetened gum
and the need for further studies
is emphasized, more so by the fact
that Smutans is known to
metabolize sorbitol.

Sore mouth
mucosa beneath
denture may become red,
smooth, swollen and granular. It
is painful. Severe burning
sensation is common. Condition
is not due to allergy.

Soup
is an appetizer that is served
in the beginning of all formal
dinners. It stimulates appetite.
Clear soups introduce fluid to the
diet. These provide sodium
chloride, potassium and minerals.
Cream of soup only provides
calories.

Soyabean
is a protein. It is three
times of an egg and four times of
wheat. It contains 20% fat. Except
for a deficiency of cystine and
methionine it is well balanced as
regards amino acids are
concerned. It contains trypsin
inhibitor which does not allow all
proteins to be utilized.

Sp reader
is a long, pointed hand
instrument used with lateral
pressure to condense the gutta
parcha points against the wall of
root canal.

Space regainer
is an appliance used
in situation where there is
premature loss of deciduous teeth
resulting in the migration of
adjacent teeth, into the edentulous
space and interferes in the
eruption of the succedaneous
permanent teeth, due to inadequate
space appliance used in
such situation to regain the lost
space due to migration and to
provide space for the eruption of
permanent teeth. Space regaining
using springs the molars can be
distalized to regain space by
using removable appliances that
incorporate simple finger springs.

Spacing
usually exists between the
deciduous teeth. These spaces are
called physiological spaces or
developmental spaces. The presence
of spaces in the primary dentition
is important for the normal
development of the primary dentition.
Absence of spaces in the
primary dentition is an indication
that crowding of teeth can occur
when the larger permanent teeth
erupt. The spacing is invariably
seen mesial to the maxillary canines
and distal to the mandibular
canines. These physiological
spaces are called leeway
space of Nance.

Spasmodic dysphonia
is a chronic
phonatory disorder of adulthood
without any obvious cause. It results
from intermittent spasmodic
hyper adduction of vocal folds
leading to jerking, effortful
strained sounds with laryngeal
discomfort.

Spasmodic torticollis
when head
is flexed it is known as ante collis,
extended it is known as
retrocollis. It may be tilted, twisted
and rotated. Some may show
head tremor and muscles
involved are sternocleidomastoid,
trapezius and scalenus.

Spastic gait
Patient walks on a
narrow base, has difficulty in
bending his knees. Actually
patient drags his feet. Foot is
raised by tilting the pelvis and leg
swings forward. It is seen in
spinal cord disease.

Specific gravity
is the ratio of the
mass of a material to an equal
volume at 4° C.

Specific heat
is the ratio of thermal
capacity of a material to that of
water at 15° C.

Specific plaque hypothesis (Walter Loeshe – 1976)
states that only
certain plaque is pathogenic and
its pathogenicity depends on the
presence of or increase in specific
micro-organisms. According to
this hypothesis plaque harboring
specific bacterial pathogens results
in periodontal disease. These
organisms produce substances
that mediate the destruction of
host tissues. Acceptance of the
specific plaque hypothesis was
confirmed by recognition of AA
comitans as pathogens in localized
aggressive periodontitis. An
increased risk for periodontal
breakdown is observed in sites
colonized by same potentially
pathogenic organisms.

Specific plaque hypothesis revisited
The disease is associated
with specific strains of a given
species. It’s likely that most, if not
all, recognized periodontal
pathogens demonstrated
difference in phenotypic
properties related to their ability
to cause disease i.e. genetic
(molecular) basis for variability in
virulence properties among
pathogenic strains to cause
periodontal diseases.

Specificity theory of pain
was
considered a specific sensation
with its own anatomically distinct
receptors, primary and cortical
reception areas. This theory
contended that only free unmyelinated
nerve endings in the
orofacial area were activated by
noxious stimuli. More recently,
the anatomical specificity of
receptors has been discarded as
most receptors, if sufficiently
stimulated can respond to
noxious irritation.

Spermatid
is the cell derived from
the secondary spermatocyte by
fission, develops into a mature
spermatozoon.

Sperms
starting from puberty
sperm production remains
continuous throughout life. Fifty
thousand are produced at every
minute. It takes seventy days to
mature fully. Once sperm are
manufactured these move for
storage and maturation to
epididymis. When man becomes
sexually aroused about 500
million mature sperms are moved
through vas deferens. Epididymis
has two degree F less temperature
than body temperature.

Sphygmomanometer
is an
instrument used in conjunction
with a stethoscope to measure
blood pressure. It consists of cloth
cuff, a pressure bulb, a measuring
gauge and a release valve. These
are of two types mercury and
aneroid one.

Spinal cord
is a continuation of
brain stem. It is a tube like
structure located within the spinal
cavity. It is 17 inches long and
extends from foramen magnum
of occipital bone to L1 level.

Spinal cord syndrome
There is a
typical type of analgesia with
thermo anesthesia bilaterally in
several dermatomes. It extends in
a cap like fashion over arms, back
and shoulder. Spastic weakness of
legs may develop. When brain
stem is involved facial analgesia
may develop. Atrophy of tongue
results in dysarthria. Person may
develop dysphagia.

Spinal tuberculosis
is a condition
where there will be variable loss
of pain and temperature
sensation and motor function. It
also causes spasticity, bladder
incontinence and absent abdominal
reflexes.

Spindle cell carcinoma
is an
unusual form of poorly
differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma consisting of spindle
shaped epithelial cells. Lesion
develops pain, ulceration and
swelling. There is fleshy but
polypoid growth pattern.
Histologically tumor cells often
exhibit marked nuclear hyperchromatism.
There is a minimum
degree of epithelial dysplasia
with little or no keratin formation.
This tumor is less aggressive
hence wider surgical excision
serve the purpose.

Spleen
is a secondary lymphoid
organ located in the upper left of
abdomen behind stomach, close
to the diaphragm. It has a collagen
capsule. Histologically it contains
a red pulp, where destruction of
RBCs takes place along with
venous sinuses and cellular
chords. White pulp contains
lymphoid tissue arranged around
a central arteriole, periarteriolar
lymphoid sheath. It is also
organized into distinct ‘b’ cell
areas and ‘t’ cell areas or follicles.
Primary unstimulated follicles
and secondary stimulated follicles
with germinal center contain
follicular dendrite cells, phagocyte
and macrophages, principally the
antigen presenting cells.

Split tooth or incomplete fracture
is a tooth that is split or cracked
but not yet fractured. The tooth
may be uncomfortable only
occasionally during mastication.
Pain may be like unbearable stab.
This is when there is crack in the
dentin and suddenly spreads as
the cusp is separated from the
remainder of tooth. Pulp may
remain hypersensitive for years.
Most frequent complaint is of
pain while biting or contracting
cold fluids. If the pulp is involved
in fracture any exciting agent will
bring on discomfort.

Sporotrichosis
is caused by
sporotrichum schenckii and
develops after exposure to
animals. It involves skin, oral,
nasal and pharyngeal mucosa.
Regional lymph glands are
enlarged. Lesions are healed by
soft, pliable scars even though
causative organism may be
present. There is no specific
treatment.

is used to join
orthodontic bonds and brackets
and to join orthodontic wires.
Work is pressed together between
two copper electrodes and electric
2 to 6 v for 1/25 to 1/50 seconds
at 250 to 750 ampere is employed.

Sprain
is an injury limited to
ligament. Sprain is a stretching
injury to a muscle or its tendinous
attachment. First degree sprain is
a tear of only a few fibres of a
ligament. There is minimal
swelling and localized tenderness.
In second degree sprain all
the fibres of a ligament are
disrupted. There is pain, swelling
and inability to use the limb. In
third degree sprain there is a
complete tear of ligament.
Often pain is minimal. It requires
immobilization of 4-6 weeks.

Spreading pain
is due to development
of painful muscle spasms.
The secondary myogenous pain
may occur some distance from the
site of its mother primary pain.
But its location bears/a segmental
relationship to the nerve which
mediates the primary pain.

Spring catarrh
patient is usually a
young boy who presents with
marked itching in the eyes which
becomes worse in summer. There
develops flat cobble stone like
papillae in the upper tarsal
conjunctiva.

Sprouting
many cereals and dals
can be sprouted to advantage.
The vitamin ‘C’ content goes up
several times and contents of
thiamine, riboflavin and
nicotinamide are often doubled.
Iron also becomes free and
absorption becomes easier.

Sprue
is a part of malabsorption
syndrome. There develops
glossitis, large pale, foul stools.
The disease starts with intestinal
problems. Excessive amount of
fats are passed in stool. There may
be severe glossitis and atrophy of
filliform papillae. Painful burning
sensations of tongue are common.
Blood findings are similar to
pernicious anaemia. Vitamin B12
helps. Gluten wheat and rye flour
should be avoided.

Squamous acanthoma
has no
distinctive clinical appearance
and can develop at any site of oral
mucosa. It is a small, flat or
elevated white or sessile or
pedunculated lesion.

Squamous cell carcinoma
is an
intraoral white lesion and is
most common to develop.
All squamous cell carcinoma
don’t invade and destroy bone.
Carcinomas originating on or
near the crest of mandibular ridge
or on the posterior hard palate are
the tumors to cause destruction of
bone. Such tumors can be of two
types peripheral or mucosal. In
peripheral type patient may
complain of worsening oral ulcer.
Person may be alcoholic or
smoking heavily. Other
complaints are foul odour and
taste. There may even be
anesthesia of lip. While in central
type patient will complain of pain
and swelling. There may be
anesthesia also. In peripheral type
lytic effects of two types are seen.
Semicircular or saucer shaped
erosion into bony surface with ill
defined borders. Mandibular
lesion with advanced horizontal
resorption is seen. Tooth may be
migrated, loose and resorbed.
Regional lymph glands will be
enlarged. Glands will be
enlarged, painless and very firm.
Central squamous cell carcinoma
is rare and appears as rounded
radiolucency. To start border is
smooth and regular, later on wall
may be destroyed with ragged
definitions. It may appear as
extended oral leukoplakia and
erythroplakia. It may be
symptom less, white or red
variegated patch. It is painless.
Advanced lesion is fast growing
irregular with large tumor mass.
Ulcer has indurated borders with
everted margin. Secondary
infection may result in pain. It
bleeds on touching. Tumor is
fixed to tongue. Regional lymph
nodes are tender, fixed and
enlarged. Untreated case may
destroy oral tissue and extend
through cheek. Patient may not be
able to eat food as pathological
fracture of jaws may take place.
Such cancer may also be present
in intestine and lung. In an oral
cavity itself two or more separate
malignant lesions may be seen.
Tongue lesions are more vascular
and start bleeding even on
slightest touch. Tongue may be
fixed to mouth and patient may
be unable to talk or swallow.
Histologically lip carcinoma is
well differentiated. Prognosis is
good, before the metastasis occurs
Radiographically bone involved
shows large, irregular and ill
defined radiolucent area and
appears as of ‘moth eaten’ type.
In addition to histopathology,
exfoliative cytology is helpful.
Toludine blue test is needed to
detect dysplastic lesions.

Squamous odontogenic tumors
in
maxilla, lesions are centered on
the incisor cuspid area while in
mandible lesions had a
predilection for bicuspid molar
area. Lesions are asymptomatic.
On X-ray it looks as triangular or
semicircular translucent area with
or without sclerotic areas. It is
made of squamous mature
epithelium. Peripheral layer is
flattened. Post surgery, there is no
recurrence.

Stab wound
is one in which depth
of wound is more than length of
skin. It is caused by sharp,
pointed object like knife, spear,
dagger etc. Edges of object may
be sharp or blunt. If sharp the
wound will be incised and blunt
wound will be lacerated and
penetrating.

Stability of vitamins carotene
is
destroyed by heat in presence of
air and copper. It can withstand
boiling in alkaline solution.
Thiamine is unstable in alkaline
condition. Riboflavin is stable to
air and destroyed by excessive
heat and light. While nicotinic
acid most stable of B-vitamins
being unaffected by light, heat,
air, acid or alkali. Only loses are
during washing. Vitamin C is
destroyed by enzyme present in
leafy vegetables. Vitamin D is
stable to all normal storage and
processing conditions.

Stafne bone defect
is a sharply
defined cyst like area of radiolucency
seen near the angle of
mandible.

Staggering gait
is common to
alcohol and barbiturate intoxication.
Base is wide and steps are
irregular.

Stain, extrinsic
is a stain located on
the outside of the tooth surface
originating from external substances
such as tobacco, coffee, tea
or food; usually removed by polishing
the teeth with an abrasive
prophylaxis paste.

Stain, intrinsic
is a stain originating
from the ingestion of certain
materials or chemical substances
during tooth development, or
from the presence of caries. This
stain is permanent and cannot be
removed.

Stainless steel
is steel containing at
least 12 percent chromium that
forms a protective oxide coating
keeping it away from corroding.

Stainless steel wire
has good
combination of mechanical
properties and corrosion resistance
in oral environment. Cost is
Staggering gait
reasonable. Modulus of elasticity
ranges from about 160 to 180 gpa.
The yield strength of these wires
ranges from 1100 to 1500 mpa.
Austenitic stainless steel alloys
can be rendered susceptible to
inter granular corrosion when
heated to 400°C to 900°C due to
formation of chromium carbides
at grain boundaries.

Stainless-steel crowns
are preformed
extra coronal restorations
that are particularly useful in the
restoration of grossly broken
down teeth, primary molars that
have undergone pulp therapy,
and hypoplastic primary or
permanent teeth. They are also
indicated when restoring the
dentition of children at high risk
of caries, particularly those
having treatment under general
anesthesia. SSCs are very durable
restorations and should be the
restoration of choice in the highcaries
mouth.

Stammering
is a disorder of
articulation by repetition of
sounds or syllables and by
prolonged pauses in speech.
Facial grimacing may accompany.
It is not a result of acquired
organic disease.

Stamping gait
is seen in sensory
ataxia. patient raises his feet very
suddenly often abnormally high
and then jerks forward bringing
to the ground with a jerk. It is seen
in tabes dorsalis.

Standard deviation
is the square
root of the variance expresed in
units of original measure.

Standard error of measurement
is
a measure of absolute reliability.
It represents the standard deviation
of measurement errors.

Standard normal distribution
is a
normal distribution with a mean
of 0.0 and a standard deviation of
1.0.

Staphylococcal pneumonia
needs
a separate description. It may
cause a confluent bronchopneumonia
in children. Due to appreciable
tissue necrosis produces
thin fluid pus. Small cystic cavities
contain thin pus and air. It
responds to antibiotics.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
is an illness which is
caused by exfoliative endotoxins
produced by S. Aureus. Symptoms
include rash, fever, malaise
and irritability. There develops
diffuse, tender, red rash with a
sand paper texture. Bullae and
vesicles may appear and
exfoliation of large sheets of
epidermis is seen.

Startle reflex
is similar to Moro
reflex, but it is initiated by a
sudden noise or any other
stimulus. In this reflex, the elbows
are flexed and the hands remains
closed and there is a less outward
and inward movement of the
arms.

Starvation
is when necessary food
has been suddenly withheld.
Feeling of hunger lasts for 36-48
hours. It is succeeded by pain in
epigastrium relieved by pressure.
After 4-5 days eyes appear
sunken and glistening pupils are
widely dilated. Cheeks become
hollow. Lips become dry and
cracked. Tongue becomes dry
and coated with thick fur. Voice
becomes weaker.

Static bone cyst
is not a true cyst
since it is not lined by epithelium.
Hence it is known as pseudo cyst.
Radiographically it is a well
defined cyst like radio lucency in
mandible inferior to mandibular
canal. It may not require any
treatment.

Static stretching
is stretching a
muscle in a stationary position.

Steam sterilization
is a process
where steam under pressure kills
all bacteria, spores, fungi and
viruses. Steam is produced in
autoclave and is kept at
temperature of 134° C for at least
3 minutes. Whole process may
take 20 minutes. Steam is suitable
for metal instruments, diamond
and tungsten, rubber, swab,
cotton and most plastics.

Stethoscope
is an instrument used
to amplify sound of heart and
lungs.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome
is a
very severe bullous form of
erythema multiforme with widespread
involvement of skin,
genitals and eyes. Suddenly patient
may develop fever, photophobia
and eruption of mucosa of oral
cavity, skin and genitalia. Oral
lesions may be so severe that
mastication becomes impossible.
There is no specific treatment.
Sometimes cortisone helps.

Sticky wax
is a brittle wax
containing resin used to hold
metal parts in investment of
soldering. It fractures instead of
deformed under stress.

Stillman’s tooth brushing method
is a method of tooth brushing
providing gingival stimulation.
Bristles are placed partly on
cervical portion of tooth and
partly on gingiva. Strokes are
completed in each region and
bush is moved to another area.
Bristle ends are not directed into
sulcus so can be recommended
for clients with progressive
recession. It is considered less
traumatic to gingiva.

Stomion inferius (Stmi)
is the
median point in the vermilion of
the lower lip.

Stomion superius (Stms)
is a point
indicating the mucocutaneous
border of the upper lip. The most
anterior point of the upper lip.

Stomach
is a dilated portion of
alimentary canal and has 3
functions. It stores food having a
capacity of 1500 ml then it mixes
the food with gastric secretion to
form a semisolid chime and
thirdly it regulates the rate of
delivery of the chyme to small
intestine. It has two openings
cardiac and pyloric, two
curvatures greater and lesser.

Stomatitis
is also known as
leukokeratosis. Smoker’s patch
develops on palate in heavy
smoker. Lesions are limited to
smoke area. To start with mucosa
is reddened but becomes greyish
white. It is thick and fissured.
Histologically epithelium shows
acanthosis and hyperkeratosis.
There is chronic inflammation in
the sub epithelial connective
tissue. If smoker stops smoking
changes are reversible. Lesion has
no precancerous potential.

Stomatitis medicamentosa
is the
term given to the eruptions
occurring in the oral cavity due
to the sensitivity of the drugs
which has been consumed orally.

Stomatitis venenata
also known as
contact stomatitis is term given to
the local reaction caused due to
the use of medicament in the oral
cavity e.g. aspirin burn.

Stone’s index
was introduced by
Stone H.H, Lawton F.E, Bransby
E R and Hartley H.O in 1949. The
scoring is done as follows: 1- one
point of one or more cavities in
the same tooth detectable by
sharp probe where the lesion has
not penetrated through the
enamel to involve the dentine. 2-
Two points to one or more
cavities in the same tooth where
the dentine is involved, where a
total of less than a quarter of the
crown is estimated to have been
destroyed. 3- Three points to one
or more cavities in the same tooth
resulting in a total destruction of
more than a quarter of the crown.

Stops
are small, round, sterile
pieces of rubber or plastic that are
placed on endodontic instruments
to mark the working
length.

Storage phosphor screen technology
this screen contains
embedded phosphorus crystals
that luminescence when stimulated
by light at a specific
wavelength. The energy released
results in a latent image that is
stored in the screen rather than on
conventional film. No darkroom/
day light loader required. No
processing chemicals needed.
Less image resolution. Less
radiation required. The image
detector is generally larger.
The image is immediately
available. Image may be
electronically transferred. Image
may be enhanced. Image is easily
altered. Image is easily copied. No
duplicating film equipment
needed. Image is large enough to
be seen by patient.

Strain
is defined as the deformation
of the length/dimension of a
dental material that results from
applied stress. The stiffness of an
object determines its ability to
resist dimensional change or
strain.

Streptococcal gingivostomatitis
is
a rare condition characterized by
a presence of diffuse erythema of
gingiva and other parts of oral
mucosa, sometimes it may also
appear as marginal erythema,
studies indicate that group a betahemolytic
streptococcus may be
a main cause to this lesion.

Streptococcus mutans
In 1924
Clarke isolated a streptococcus
that predominated in many
human carious lesions and that he
named streptococcus mutans
because of its varying morphology.
Clarke noted that
s.mutans adhered closely to tooth
surfaces in artificially induced
caries for the next 40 years;
s.mutans was virtually ignored,
until the 1960s when it was
“rediscovered” and its prevalence
in plaque confirmed. Characteristics
of this group of
streptococci have been described
as non motile, catalase-negative,
gram–positive cocci in short or
medium chains. On mitissalivarius
agar they grow as
highly convex to pulvinate
(cushion–shaped) colonies. These
colonies are opaque; the surface
resembles frosted glass. These
s.mutans variants also posses
caries –inducing properties, and
when re-isolated from infected
animals they may resume the
original rough colonial form.

Streptomycin
is bactericidal and
acts against gram positive and
gram negative bacteria prevents
bacterial protein synthesis. It is
active against tuberculosis. In
high doses toxicity is marked of
eighth cranial nerve, vestibular
damage is first noted. Auditory
division is less vulnerable but
tinnitus and deafness can occur.
It is given I.M and is painful.

Stress
is when an external force is
applied to a specimen an internal
force equal in magnitude but
opposite in direction is set up.
Stress = f/a where ‘f’ is the
applied force and ‘a’ is the cross
sectional area.

Stridor
is a respiration produced by
turbulent air flow through a
narrow air passage. Inspiratory
stridor is produced in obstructive
lesions of supraglottis while
expiratory stridor is produced in
lesions of thoracic trachea and
bronchial foreign body and
tracheal stenosis. It is a noise
produced by breathing when the
trachea or larynx is obstructed. It
is louder than wheezing.

Stroke
is an abrupt loss of neurological
function. It may be caused
from atherosclerosis, aneurysm
and malformations, decreased
perfusion pressure and hemorrhage.
Atherosclerosis is the most
common cause of cerebral infarction.
Hyper viscosity, hypercoagulability
by producing cerebral
venous thrombosis can impair
cerebral blood flow. Smoking,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension
and hyperlipidemia with obesity
are the predisposing factors.

Strokes
are referred as the vertical
or oblique movements performed
during instrumentation.

Structural spinal disorder pain
disc degeneration result in pain
which is aggravated by activities.
Staying in one position for long
may also result in pain. Partial
relief may be got by rest. Disc pain
becomes worse with sitting, bending,
lifting and straining activities.
Pain is worst with extension type
of activities.

Strychnine poisoning
occurs due
to poisonous, flat, circular disc,
concave on one and convex on
other side. They are 2 cm in diameter
and ¼” thick. Ash gray in
color have shiny surface. These
are too bitter. It acts with in 5 to
10 minutes. Chocking sensation in
throat and stiffness of neck, face
and stretching of face start. Convulsion
are first clonic and then
becomes tonic.

Sturge–Webber disease
is
congenital disease with
combination of angioma of lepto
meninges over cerebral cortex
with angiomatous lesion of face.
Sturge – Webber syndrome
person develops orofacial and
meningeal angiomatosis with
secondary mental deficiency.
There may be seizures, hemiplegia
and mild to severe enlargement
of gingiva. Hyperplastic
vascular gingival blanch on
pressure. Bony hemangiomas and
delayed tooth eruption may be
noted. Convulsions may be
controlled by anticonvulsant
drugs.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage
can be
caused by rupture of a cerebral
aneurysm or rupture of
arteriovenous malformation. Early
diagnosis and surgery has a
significant future. Symptoms
include worst headache of life,
neck pain and back and radicular
pain. Focal or generalized
neurological abnormalities may be
seen. Causative factors are saccular
aneurysm, ruptured AV
malformation and hypertension.
Saccular aneurysms are congenital
thin sac like protrusion from circle
of wills. It develops in anterior
circulation. Mycotic aneurysms
occur at distal ends of cerebral
vessels. Person will develop
orbital pain/occipital headache.
CSF study shows blood.
Xanthochromia and RBC in CSF
disappear after 2 weeks of blood.

Subclinical
is without clinical
manifestation.

Subdural hematoma
There will be
decreased level of consciousness
involving head injury. Seizures
may develop with focal neurologic
symptoms. Confusion and
personality change results. Pupil
will dilate with hemiparesis.

Subgingival biofilm
forms below
the subgingival plaque residing in
a more protected location is not
subject to the same degree of
intraoral abrasion or salivary host
defense components. The main
determinants limiting its growth
are physical space and the innate
defense system of the host. One
result of subgingival plaque
accumulation is a continual
increase in the space available by
reducing epithelial cell
attachment levels and increasing
pocket depth. The innate host
defense system limits this spread
by maintaining an intact epithelial
cell barrier. GCF, although a rich
source of nutrients, contains a
potent array of antimicrobial
activities. It contains innate
components which include
lysozymes, complement and a
variety of vascular permeability
enhancers such as Bradykinin,
thrombin and fibrinogen and
adaptive components including
antibodies and lymphocytes.

Subgingival calculus
is the one
which is located below the crest
of the marginal gingiva and is
therefore not visible in the oral
cavity. The calculus is hard, dense
and frequently dark in color.
Sublingual calculus are generally
much harder being denser. Such
calculus is less extensive, flatter
and more brittle and darker in
color. These are deposited at
irregular intervals throughout
life.

Sublingual gland
produces 2-5% of
total salivary volume. It lies above
the mylohyoid, below the mucosa
of the floor of the mouth, medial
to the sublingual fossa of the
mandible and lateral to the
genioglossus. About 15 ducts
emerge from the gland. Most of
them open directly into the floor
of the mouth on the summit of the
sublingual fold. A few of them
join the submandibular duct.

Sublingual keratosis
develops as
white lesion on the floor of mouth
and ventral tongue. Malignant
changes have been noted. It is a
white soft plaque with a finely
wrinkled surface. There is
irregular but well defined outline.
There is no associated inflammation
(see Figure).

Sublingual plaque
is a plaque that
forms under the gum line.

Sublingual space
refers to the
space existing below the oral
mucosa in the anterior part of the
floor of the mouth and contains
sublingual gland, its excretory
ducts, submandibular duct which
is traversed by lingual nerve and
hypoglossal nerve. Infection to
this area raises the floor of the
mouth and displaces tongue,
resulting in pain and difficulty in
swallowing.

Submandibular gland
is a paired
muco-serous gland lying in the
submandibular space. The
inferior surface is covered by skin,
platysma, and submandibular
lymph nodes. Lateral surface is
related to, submandibular fossa of
mandible and medial surface is
related to the extrinsic muscles of
tongue and mylohyoid muscle.
Secretions are discharged into the
oral cavity through Wharton’s
duct which runs forward from the
anterior border of the upper part,
raising a fold of mucous
membrane in the floor of the
mouth and opens on little papilla
to the side of the lingual papilla
just behind the lower incisor
teeth. The submandibular duct is
approximately 5 cm long.

Submandibular space
refers to the
space existing external to the sublingual
space, below the mylohyoid
and hyoglossus muscle. The
space contains the submandibular
gland, which extends slightly
above the mylohyoid muscle thus
communicating with sublingual
space.

Submental space
refers to the space
existing between the mylohyoid
muscle superiorly and the
platysma inferiorly, bounded
posteriorly by hyoid bone and
laterally by mandible. It is
traversed by anterior belly of
digastrics muscle. Infection
results in swelling of submental
region.

Submerged teeth
are generally
deciduous teeth specially second
molar which undergoes variable
degree of root absorption. It
becomes ankylosed with bone.
X-ray confirms it.

Subphrenic abscess
intra
peritoneal infection, appendicitis
or perforation of G.I. Tract may
result in it. Pus may track from
one compartment to another
compartment. General symptoms
are more marked than any local
symptoms. There will be
unexplained fever, right upper
abdominal tenderness and pain.
Liver is pushed down and
diaphragm is elevated. Chest
movement is slowed down.
Surgical drain under antibiotic
cover helps.

Substance polypeptide
acts as an
excitatory neurotransmitter. It is
released from spinal cord cells by
A and C fibre afferent stimulation
and excites dorsal horn neurons.

Substrate
is the material being
abraded.

Succedaneous
is a tooth that
replaces or succeeds another.

Succedaneous teeth
are permanent
teeth which replace or succeed the
primary teeth. While permanent
molars are nonsuccedaneous
teeth they don’t replace primary
teeth.

Suckling
is a specialized form of
ingestion where mother’s nipple
is drawn deep in mouth. Everted
lips form a seal lingual muscular
activity generates a peustaetic
wave moving posteriorly which
milk the nipple and propels it
toward the pharynx.

Sucralose
is an artificial sweetner
that is 600 times sweeter than
sucrose derived from sucrose.
It is claimed not to be hydrolyzed
nor dechlorinated in the body.

Sucrose
is a disaccharide composed
of glucose + fructose i.e. table
sugar.

Suicidal wounds
are located inside
the mouth, over temple, under
chin or on left side of chest. Fire
arm may remain grasped in
cadaveric spasm. Wound is
directed from below upwards.
Wound is single. Due to close
range of wound scorching or
blackening of area is found. There
will be no signs of struggle. Room
may be locked from inside and
farewell note may be found.

Sulcular epithelium
lines the
sulcus of the gingiva and can be
described as thin, nonkeratinized
stratified squamous epithelium
which extends from the coronal
limit of the junctional epithelium
to border of marginal gingiva.

Sulcular fluid
is the tissue fluid that
seeps into the gingival sulcus
through the wall of sulcus.

Sulcus
is a broad depression on the
chewing surfaces of your back
teeth.

Sulphonamide
are generally
bacteriostatic rather than
bactericidal. It acts by interfering
with the utilization of para amino
benzoic acid bacteria. In 1900 first
sulphonamide para-aminobenzene-
sulphomide was synthesized.
It is extensively used in
gonorrhoea. Kidney excretes it.
Occasional occurrence of
Agranulocytosis may develop.
Mostly these are used in
respiratory and urinary tract
infection.

Summation theory
is an alternative
theory postulating that pain does
not depend on specific pathways
but on excessive stimulation
involving all types of receptors
with the resultants central neural
summation or convergence of
activity.

Superego
is prohibition learned
from environment, more from
parents and authorities. Act as
censor of acceptability of
thoughts feeling and behavior. It
is determined by regulation
imposed on the child by parent’s
society and culture. It is
internalized control produced a
feeling of shame guilt. The
expression of discomfort (anxiety
fear) by the child is the result
conflict between the three
components as the psychic
structure.

Superficial dermal
burns are the
one which involve the epidermis
and the papillary dermis. These
also heal on their own by
epithelial growth from the
abundant skin appendages but
slower than epidermal burns
because as we go deeper the
number of epithelial cells
decreases and amount of connective
tissue increases. Therefore the
healing in these burns is by
regeneration and repair both
which gives a scar. These usually
heal in 14 days.

Superficial partial thickness burns
refer superficial dermal burns.

Superior alveolar neuriti
 involves
maxillary dental plexus and is the
direct extension of inflammation
of antral mucosa. There may be
burning neuritic pain. No muscle
or autonomic symptoms are
present.

Superior levator labii alaque nasi
arises from frontal portion of
maxilla. It passes obliquely
downwards and divides into two
medial and lateral slips. The
laterals slip raises and events the
upper lip, the medial slip acts as
a dilator of nostril.

Supernumerary breasts
usually
occur along milk line extending
from nipple to the symphysis
pubis. These can be seen as small
spots of two to three minutes.

Supernumerary roots
refer to
development of increased number
of roots on a tooth compared with
that classically described in dental
anatomy. Both deciduous and
permanent can be involved.
Detection of supernumerary root
is critical when endodontic
therapy and exodontics is under
taken. Otherwise no specific
treatment is required.

Supernumerary teeth
are the extra
teeth, in addition to the development
of the normal 32.
Supernumerary teeth occur more
frequently in the permanent
dentition. 90% of the cases occur
in the maxilla with strong
predilection for the anterior
region. The most common region
is the maxillary central incisor
followed by maxillary 4th molar.
Most supernumerary teeth are
unilateral. Supernumerary tooth
located between maxillary central
incisors is termed mesiodens.
Supernumerary 4th molar is
called distomolar. A supernumerary
tooth situated lingually or
buccally to a molar is called
paramolar. Supernumerary teeth
are morphologically classified as
either supplemental or rudimentary.
Supplemental teeth duplicate
the typical anatomy of
posterior or anterior teeth.
Rudimentary supernumerary
teeth are dysmorphic and can
assume conical or tuberculate
form. The eruption of supernumerary
teeth is variable and
depends on the space available.
70% of supernumerary teeth in
the anterior maxilla fail to erupt.
In such situation midline
diastema is common. Whenever
there is a large midline diastema,
radiographic evaluation to detect
presence of supernumerary tooth
is essential. Supernumerary teeth
can also prevent eruption of
adjacent teeth, displacement or
rotation, crowding. Unerupted
supernumerary teeth can be
associated with cyst. At times
they can erupt into nasal cavity
as well. Meticulous clinical and
radiographic examination is
required to detect supernumerary
teeth. Horizontal tube shift
technique where two periapical
radiographs are taken at different
horizontal angulation is helpful in
detecting the position of the
unerupted teeth.

Suppurations
is a purulent
discharge forming in the wound
cavities. Common suppuration is
lung abscess, brain abscess,
pyocele and perpural sepsis.
Similarly common infection can
also give rise rigors such as tonsillitis,
sinusitis and bronchiectasis.

Suppurative arthritis of Temporo mandibular Joint
consists of
spasm of masseter muscles,
difficulty of opening of mouth.
There can be fever, leukocytosis
and general malaise. X-ray may
show normal findings.

Suppurative inflammation
damage to vessels is severe.
Plenty of neutrophils are killed in
inflammation. Dead neutrophil
and degraded products, necrosed
tissue with inflammation is called
purulent inflammation.

Suprabony pocket
pocket is the
term used where the base of the
pocket is coronal to the underlying
alveolar bone. It is also
known as supracrestal and supra
alveolar pocket.

Supragingival biofilm
forms
above the gingival margin.
Supragingival plaque growth,
being located in contact with the
oral cavity, is subject to much
more intraoral abrasion which
restricts its net accumulation. In
addition, this biofilm is subject to
flow characteristics of saliva and
its host defense components.
Saliva contains secretory IgA,
lactoferrin, lysozymes and
peroxidases that display a wide
spectrum of antimicrobial activity
and serve to limit both colonization
and spread of the supragingival
bacterial biofilm.

Supragingival calculus
is the
calculus which is present coronal
to the gingival margin and is
visible in the oral cavity. It is
usually whitish yellow in color,
clay like consistency and easily
detached from the oral cavity. It
mainly occurs on the lingual
aspect of the lower incisors and
the buccal aspect of the maxillary
molars.

Supragingival
is the area above the
gingival margin.

Supragingival plaque
is a plaque
located above the gingival
margin.

Surface anesthetics
are the agents
that anesthetize the surface of
mucous membrane so that
syringe needle can be inserted
painlessly. It is used as spray,
solution/paste. It is applied a few
minutes before the injection. 5%
lignocaine generally used.

Surface coat
is the first coating
applied to a wax pattern or the
surface of mould that comes in
direct contact with a cast metal.

Surface energy
is an extra energy
that atoms or molecules on the
surface of a substance have over
those in the interior. The surface
energy of a liquid is referred to
as surface tension expressed in
erg/cm2.

Surface tension force
acting
parallel to the boundary surface,
generally expressed in dynes/cm.

Surgical chisels and hoes
are the
instruments used during the
periodontal surgery for removing
and reshaping the bone. The hoe
has curved shank and blade
whereas the chisel is straight
shanked. The surgical hoe has
flattened fishtail shaped blade
with a pronounced convexity in
its terminal portion. It is used for
detaching pocket walls after the
gingivectomy incisions. It is
helpful for smoothening root and
bone surfaces.

Surgical ciliated cyst of maxilla
develops after surgical entry into
maxillary sinus. Patient
complains of nonspecific poorly
localized pain and tenderness.
Swelling is evident. X-ray will
show radiolucent area closely
related to maxillary sinus. Filling
defect of cyst can be seen.
Treatment includes enucleation.

Surgical crown lengthening
is the
process where clinical crown
height of teeth can be increased
by surgically repositioning the
gingival margin with alveolar
bone recontouring. This procedure
creates longer teeth but
maintains the existing vertical
dimension.

is the one who is
unable to resist infection by the
pathogens. Host is in poor health
and has compromised immune
system.

Sutural dominance theory
was put
forward by Sicher and says that
proliferation of sutural connective
tissue causes appositional
growth. Genetic factor was accepted
and the membranous bones
were considered as growth centers.

Suture
is a joining of two bones,
also stitches.

Suture instruments
include
dissecting forceps, needle
holders, suture needle, spencer
wall forceps and scissors.

Suture needle
is a curved needle
used with suture material to close
the surgical site.

is a complex muscular
act which prevents the ball of food
entering nasal cavity or larynx. It
is propelled by the tongue from
mouth to the back of throat. From
here it goes down to esophagus.

is an
extravasation of sweat in the
tissue with subsequent inflammation,
keratin plug formation in
sweat glands.

is prominent. Headache, dizziness,
disturbed hearing and
vision, mental confusion are
experienced. Respiration is
stimulated and blood pressure
may be elevated. Pupils first
constrict and later on dilate.

Symptoms
are effects of disease
noticed by patient himself.

Synchondrosis
refers to absent or
minimal movements of joints.
Examples include intercostals
joint and a joint between
diaphysis and epiphysis.

Syncope
is a transient loss of
consciousness without prodromal
symptoms that is followed within
seconds to minutes (< 30 minutes)
by resumption of consciousness.
Although many causes do exist,
a closer examination reveals 3
factors. These factors include
stress, impaired physical status,
administration or ingestion of
drugs. Syncope is a complicated
problem frequently encountered
in clinical practice. It describes a
loss of consciousness, usually
from a sudden decrease in
cerebral blood flow. Brain can
with stand only a few seconds of
total interruption of blood flow
without loss of consciousness. It
is the most common medical
emergency encountered in dental
office cause may be fear, anxiety,
emotional upset or pain due to
reduced flow of blood to the
brain. Facial skin becomes pallor
and clammy. Pulse rate increases
markedly, pupils dilate and depth
of respiration increases.

Syndesmoses
in these joint bones
are held together by an
intraosseous ligament. Example
includes inferior tibiofibular joint
and radio ulnar joint.

with broad spectrum disinfecting
action.

Syphilitic oral ulcer
is painless
until secondarily infected. Lip or
tip of tongue is affected. Size may
vary from 5 mm to several cms.
Edges of ulcer are raised and
indurated. It is highly infectious
and heals without scar. Regional
lymph glands are enlarged,
rubbery and discrete.

Systemic lupus erythematosis
was
described by Sir William Osler in
1895. He described the systemic
manifestations of this chronic
systemic inflammatory disease
with alternating exacerbations
and remissions. It is characterized
by multi organ involvement
including polyarthritis (polyarthralgia,
avascular bone
necrosis). Skin butterfly rash, is an
erythematous rash involving
areas of body, chronically exposed
to UV light, mucosal ulceration,
oral and genital mucosa in
15% cases. Nephritis, glomerulitis
either diffuse membranous,
sclerosing with small vessel
vasculitis, splinter hemorrhage,
periungual occlusion, finger pulp
infarctions may develop.

Systemic sclerosis
is a progressive
fibrosis of skin and multiple
organs. There is induration of skin
and fixation of epidermis to the
deeper subcutaneous tissue. It
begins on face, hands and trunk.
Skin becomes yellow, gray or
ivory white waxy appearance.
Tongue, soft palate and larynx are
the structures involved. Tongue
often becomes stiff and board like.
Gingival tissues are pale and
unusually firm. Lips become thin,
rigid and partially fixed.
Dysphagia and chocking sensation
also develop. There is no
adequate treatment.

Systemic therapy
is a treatment
that reaches and affects cells
through out the body.

T–cells
do not express Ig
but detect presence of
foreign substances by
way of surface protein
called T Cell Receptor
(TCR). TCR is a
heterogeneous clan of
membrane proteins on Tcells
consisting of a pair
of transmembrane polypeptides of
alpha and beta chains. TCR share
structural and functional
properties with Ig and are closely
related to each other in evolution.
TCR are never secreted; hence, T
cells lack the ability to strike their
targets at long distance. They exert
their protective effects through
direct contact with a target or by
influencing activity of other
immune cells. They are the
principal cells involved in cellmediated
immunity. T cells can
detect foreign substances only in
specific context; can recognize a
foreign particle only if first cleaved
into small peptides and displayed
on the surface of second host cell
‘antigen presenting cell (APC)’.
Antigen presentation depends on
specific protein ‘Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)’
in surface of APC and this
combination is recognized by a T
cell receptor.

Tactile
pertaining to touch.

Tactile sensitivity
is the ability to
distinguish relative degrees of
roughness and smoothness on the
surface of tooth.

Talons cusp (Accessory cusps/supernumerary cusps)
is a cusp
like structure projecting from the
cingulum of incisors. In shape it
resembles an eagle’s talon. It can
be considered as dens evaginatus
of anterior teeth. It is predomina-T
tely seen on maxillary permanent
lateral incisors and very rarely
seen on deciduous teeth. Like dens
evaginatus talon cusp is composed
of enamel, dentin and pulp
extension. Talon cusp is common
in Chinese, Caucasians and
African–Americans. Incidence of
talon cusp is high in patients with
Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome and
Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Tansfixation
is a type of method of
achieving immobilization in
dentulous as well as edentulous
mandible using Kirschner wires,
where 2 mm krischner wire is
inserted within the medullary
cavity across the fracture line.
The wire is cut off at skin entry
point from where it can be
withdrawn once.

Tardive dyskinesia
is a repetitive
uncontrolled activity of head, jaw,
tongue and lips. It may occur due
to long term use of phenothiazines.
Symptoms include rapid
repetitive movements of lips.

Tarnish
is a chemical reaction
between a metal and its environment
that results in discoloration
of the surface of metal.

Taste
is a sensation and may be
deformed in many ways. Ageusia
is a complete loss of taste while
hypogeusia is decreased taste for
all taste stimuli. Dysguesia is a
perversion of taste. Hypergeusia
is an increased sensitivity for all
tastes, while gustatory agnosia is
a loss of ability to distinguish and
identify different tastes.

Taurodontism
is an enlargement of
the body and pulp chamber of a
multirooted tooth with apical
displacement of the pulpal floor
and bifurcation of the roots.
Affected teeth tend to be rectangular
in shape and a bull like
appearance. There is increased
apico-occlusal height of pulp
chamber and furcation is close to
the apex. The diagnosis is made
from the radiographic appearance.
Depending on the degree
of apical displacement of the
pulpal floor taurodontism can be
mild, moderate or severe. If
endodontic treatment is required
in such tooth, the shape of the
pulp chamber increases the
difficulty of locating, instrumenting
and obturating the pulp
canals.

Teething
is a process where the
baby teeth are pushing through
gums.

Temper
refers to the spring
character of an orthodontic wire,
which is related to the mechanical
properties of yielding strength
and resilience.

Temporal arteritis
is a rare, febrile
or inflammatory disease of
variable duration. Distended
arteries are extremely tender on
palpation. Headache, scalp
hyperalgesias and painful
mastication are present. It is a
type of immunologic vasculitis
and is a self limiting disease of
many days.

Temporal lobe tumor
produces
expressive aphasia and impaired
performance of hearing. Auditory
illusions, hallucination
psychomotor seizure or visual
hallucination develop.

Temporary bridges
are those
intermitent restorations that are
necessary between visits to
prevent pain and space closure.

Temporary fillings
are a first aid
measure to relieve pain. Zinc
oxide, Zinc phosphate and gutta
percha are used. These are soft
and soluble and will not remain
for long hence are not to be used
for permanent filling.

Temporomandibular disorder
is a
deviation from normal function
which includes restricted
movement of mandible, 2 mm
deviation of mandible on
opening, pain on palpation of
masticatory muscles. There may
be sound in temporomandibular
joint and pain during chewing
and swallowing.

Temporomandibular dysfunction
involves both muscle and joint
derangements. Physical therapy
and relaxation techniques are
beneficial. Intraoral splints
provide relief.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ)
is
a synovial joint where temporo
(temporal bone), mandibular
(lower jaw) is the connecting
hinge between the lower jaw and
base of the skull.

Temporomandibular joint arthritis
occurs during periods of
severe psychic stress, clenching
and bruxism may become
exaggerated and lead to severe
mandibular joint and muscle
pain. Marital problems,
menopause and fatigue all may
result the condition. X-ray may
show evidence of bone resorption
or irregularity of head of condyle
or anterior slope of glenoid fossa.

TENS
stands for Transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation which
has been used in the treatment of
phantom limb pain; peripheral
nerve injury joint pain, etc.
Electrical stimulus is typically
generated from a portable battery
operated device. Mode of action
is not very well understood. It
blocks pain signals carried over
to small unmyelinated ‘C’ fibres.

Tension headache
is bilateral and
diffuse. It is felt as a sense of
tightness, pressure in head and
band like constriction. Onset is
gradual and may persist for a few
days. During worry and anxiety
headache is worst. These
responses best to anxiolytics and
antidepressants.

Teratogenesis
is the development
of organic defects due to certain
drug used in pregnancy.

Teratoma
is the neoplasm composed
of multiple tissues including
those which are normally not
found in the organ in which it
arises. It is a heterotopic collection
of various forms. Benign tumors
are cystic lesions. Walls of lesion
are thickened. These contain hair,
sebaceous material and teeth.
Teeth are uncommon in malignant
form of teratoma. Teeth
resemble bicuspid.

Tertian fever
refers to the type of
fever that comes on alternate day.

Tertiary health care
offers super
specialized care. It is proved by
regional and central level of
institutions.

Tertiary prevention
is a post
pathogenic prevention. It
includes techniques designed to
replace lost tissues and rehabilitate
a normal like function. It is
done to prevent any further
damage and maintain homeostasis.

Tertiary syphilis
develops after
5-10 years of primary lesion
affecting every organ of the body.
It mainly affects CNS and CVS.
Typical lesion is ‘gumma’. It is a
localized chronic granulomatous
lesion having either nodular or
ulcerated surface. Ulcer is a
punched out ulcer having vertical
walls. Base is dull, red granulomatous
with irregular outline.
Skin lesions leave tissue paper
like scars.

Tertiary syphilitic oral ulcer
is a
very rarely seen after the invent
of penicillin. It is known as
gumma, a destructive granulomatous
process. It is painless.
Usually palate, tongue and tonsils
are affected. Shape is round with
punched out areas. Floor is
depressed with a pale appearance.
Edges are punched out.

Testes
are located in scrotum.
Testosterone is a steroid secreted
on the stimulation of luteinizing
hormone. It helps in maturation
of sperm and is responsible for
sex characteristics. It helps in
growth and development of male
reproductive organs, musculoskeletal
growth, growth and
distribution of hair and
enlargement of larynx accompanied
by voice changes.

Tetanus
is a disease that is caused
by a gram positive, actively
motile, anerobic spore bearing
rod called clostridium tetani. It is
found in soil and horse dung.
Organism may enter through
injury. Clinical features develop
within 14 days. Symptoms appear
once toxins fix to cell bodies of
motor nerves. Incubation period
is 5 to 15 weeks. Short duration
indicates of serious disease.
Titanic spasm follows within
24-72 hours of lock jaw. Diagnosis
is clinical and does not require
clinical confirmation. Convulsion
becomes less frequent after 10
days and survivors recover
completely by 4 weeks. There
develops pain and stiffness in
jaws and neck muscle. It results
in dysphagia. After stimuli reflex
spasm develops. Cranial tetanus
paralyses 7th nerve.

Tetany
is a condition that occurs
due to low extracellular calcium
condition developing with
marked muscle cramps, twitching
and convulsions.

Tetracycline
is a broad spectrum
antibiotic drug which forms
complex with calcium and
deposit on tooth. Tetracycline has
a wider range of activity.
Spectrum includes most species
of gram positive and gram
negative bacteria and spirochetes.
These are absorbed slowly from
GIT. Larger the dose, less of
proportion is absorbed. Peak
levels in blood occur after 3 hours
hence 6 hour interval between
two doses is sufficient. All
tetracyclines are chelating agents.
In fetus or growing child
permanent staining of teeth may
occur. The degree and color of
staining varies with different
tetracycline in different doses.
Retardation of fetal growth is
noted down when given during
pregnancy.

Tetracycline pigmentation
fluoresces bright yellow under
ultraviolet light. Tetracycline can
cross the placenta to stain the
developing teeth and fetus. It is
deposited along the incremental
lines of dentine. Long treatment
produces broader band of stain
and deeper discoloration. Stain is
permanent and incisors become
ugly.

Tetracycline stains
are endogenous
stains that occured due to the use
of tetracycline drug at the time of
prenatal or postnatal dental
development. The drug was
widely used once upon a time to
fight variety of infections. At that
point little was known about the
side effects of the drug. The
antibiotic has an affinity towards
the mineralized tissue and gets
absorbed by the hard tissues of
the body. Since the drug also has
a capability to pass across the
placenta and enters the fetal
circulation, so when the expecting
mother is administered this drug
during the third trimester, the
drug gets deposited in the
forming bones and teeth of the
fetus. Discoloration can also occur
when the drug is administered to
the child in infancy and early
childhood.

Thalamic pain
can occur due to
spinal cord lesions that affects
spinothalamic tracts resulting in
painful limbs. Similarly a lesion
of thalamus itself may cause
severe pain in the contralateral
face and arm/leg. Thalamic pain
is intense, burning and
continuous. It is felt around angle
of mouth and cheek.

Thalassemia
is a group of chronic
hemolytic anemia. The disease is
inherited as autosomal dominant
trait. It produces thin, fragile
erythrocytes. In this condition,
there is insufficient synthesis of
alpha and beta chains of
hemoglobin. It is detected in first
two years of life. There may be
jaundice, fever with chills.
Marked anemia is of microchronic
microcytic type. WBC
count is high with malaise. Bone
marrow shows cellular hyperplasia
with large number of
immature primitive and stem
form of red cells. Spleen is
enlarged. Mongoloid face is due
to prominence of premaxilla.
Death often occurs during
puberty. Oral manifestations
include spacing of anterior
maxillary teeth. Pallor of oral
mucosa, bimaxillary protrusion
and Prominent molar bones with
delayed pneumatization of
sinuses develop discoloration of
teeth is due to iron. Skull bones
will show “hair on end”
appearance. Jaw bones may show
“salt and pepper effect”.

Thelarche
is faster breast
development in absence of
additional signs of sexual
maturation. Exact cause is not
known.

Theory
is a paper about relationship
specially defined concepts
that describe, explain or predict
some phenomenon in professional
discipline/action.

Therapeutic Inhalation
Menthol
and eucalyptus form an aromatic
inhalation and this when mixed
with hot water gives rise to
vapors. These when inhaled
sooths the inflamed mucous
membrane. Steam serves the
purpose of humidifying the dry
mucosal secretions and facilitate
their removal.

Therapeutic occlusion
is said to be
present where the specific
interventions are designed to treat
the disease.

Therapy
refers to the treatment of
a disease.

Thermal conductivity
is a measure
of speed at which heat travels per
second through a given thickness
of 1 cm when one side of material
is maintained at a constant
temperature i.e. 1° C higher than
the other side. Thermal conductivity
depends on the distance heat
travels, area through which heat
travels and the difference of
temperature between source and
destination.

Thermal diffusivity
is a measure
of heat transfer of a material in the
time dependant state.

Thermogenic
is a process that
creates heat.

Thermometer
is the device used to
measure temperature.

Thermoplastic
is the property of
softening on heating and
hardening on cooling.

Thermoset
is a polymer which is
not able to undergo softening
upon heating.

Thiamine (Vitamin B1)
was the
first of the Vitamin B complex
discovered. Thiamine B1 vitamin
is water soluble and is destroyed
by refining, exposure to alkalies
such as baking powder. Up to
50% is lost in cooking water and
15% during baking. Toasting of
bread destroys further 15% for
thick slice or up to 30% for thin
slice. Recommended daily intake
is 0.4 mg/ 1000 Kcal or about 1.2
mg in adult man. Limited amount
is synthesized by microorganisms
in GIT. Normally, about 25-35 mg
is stored in the body. Deficiency
of it leads to accumulation of
pyruvic and lactic acid in tissues
and body fluids. Severe deficiency
may lead to neurological and
mental deficiency.

Thiazides
are derivatives of
sulphonamides and are used as
weaker diuretics. These exert
their diuretic effect by inhibiting
the Na+ CL- transport in early
distal convoluted tubules. These
cause increased loss of K+ and Mg
but reduce calcium excretion.
These are indicated in hypertension,
mild heart failure, and
idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Thiopentone
has largely been
superseded in outpatient dental
practice by short acting methohexitone.
Thiopentone is freshly
prepared to produce 2.5%
solution by dissolving powder in
sterile distilled water. Dose is 4 to
7 mg/kg body weight. It is a
powerful myocardial depressant.

Third branchial arch
Branchial
arches are formed in the
pharangeal wall due to the
prolyeratring ateral plate
mesoderm and migrating neural
crest cell. The arches are clearly
seen as bulges on the lateral
aspect of the embryo and are
externally separated by small cleft
called branhial grooves and
internally small depression called
pharyngeal pouches. The
cartilage of this small arch
produces the greater horn and
caudal part of the body of the
hyoid bone. The remainder of the
cartilage disappears. The
mesoderm forms the stylopharyngeal
muscle, inerveted by the
IXth nerve glossopharyngeal
supplying the arch. The mucosa
of the posterior third of the
tongue is derived from this arch,
which accounts for its sensory
innervations by the glossopharyngeal
nerve. The artery of this
arch contributes to the common
carotid and part of the internal
carotid arteries. Neural crest
tissue in the third arch forms the
carotid body which first appears
as a mesenchymal condensation
around the third aortic arch
artery. This chemoreceptor body
thus derives its nerve supply from
the glossopharyngeal nerve.

Third degree burns
is involving
entire epidermis and dermis and
all dermal appendages so there is
no spontaneous healing of the
wound, leaving an ulcer. Since the
entire thickness of skin is burned
with no tissue left for repair and
regeneration, these will require
skin grafting or will close by
contractures wherein two raw
surfaces fuse together.

Third pharyngeal pouch
the
ventral diverticulum endoderm
proliferates and migrates from
each side to form two elongated
diverticulum that grow caudally
into the surrounding mesenchyme
to form the elements of
thymus gland. The two thymic
rudiments meet in the midline but
do not fuse, being united by
connective tissue. Lymphoid cells
invade the thymus from
hemopoietic tissue during the 3rd
month of IU. The dorsal
diverticulum endoderm differentiates
and migrates caudally to
form inferior parathyroid gland.
The gland derived from the
endodermal lining of the pouch
loses their connection with the
pharyngeal wall when the
pouches become obliterated
during later development. The
lateral glosso-epiglotic fold
represents the third pharyngeal
pouch.

Three–quarter crowns
actually
covers four–fifths of the tooth
surface–mesial, distal, occlusal,
lingual or palatal. They are
always made up of cast metal and
are used when the buccal surface
of the tooth is intact. The
advantage of these types of
crowns is that they are more
conservative of tooth tissue than
complete crowns and the margin
does not approach gingival
margin buccally.

Thromboangitis obliterans
is an
inflammatory occlusive peripheral
vascular disease of
unknown etiology affecting
arteries and veins especially of
lower limbs. Smoking is the risk
factor. Small and medium sized
arteries are more involved. There
is proliferation of intima and
thrombosis. There develops
digital ulceration or pain from
ischemia. Arteriography and
biopsy are confirmatory.

Thrombocythemia
is an increased
number megakaryocytes resulting
in a raised level of circulating
platelets that is mostly dysfunctional.
Etiology is not known.
Epistaxia and intestinal bleeding
exists. Hemorrhage into skin is
found. There may be spontaneous
gingival bleeding. After dental
extraction also excessive bleeding
takes place. Radioactive phosphorus
and blood transfusion
helps.

Thrombocytopenia
is very low
quantity of platelets in circulatory
system. These patients have
tendency to bleed from small
capillaries while in hemophilia
bleeding is from larger vessels. As
a result large punctate bleeding
develops over skin. For bleeding
count should fall below 50,000 per
cu/mm. Level below 10,000
becomes lethal.

Thromboplastin
Substance is
produced in blood. It plays a role
in the coagulation process.

Throttling
is a condition where the
constriction is produced by
pressure of fingers and palm.
Finger marks may be found on
either side of front of neck i.e.
wind pipe. Marks are obliquely
downwards and outwards one
below the other.

Throwing power
is a measure of
the uniformity in plating
thickness of irregular surface.

Thrush
is known as psuedomembranous
candidiasis. Actually it is
a superficial infection of upper
layers of mucosal epithelium. It
forms a patchy white plaques or
flecks on mucosal surface. Once
you remove this area of erythema
shallow ulceration is seen.
Antifungal drugs are helpful. In
infants lesions are soft, white or
bluish. It is adherent to oral
mucosa. Intraoral lesions are
painless and being removed with
difficulty. It leaves a raw bleeding
surface. Any mucosal area of
mouth may be involved. Constitutional
symptoms are not
present but in adults rapid onset
of a bad taste may develop. Some
may feel burning of mouth also.
Causative organisms are yeast
like fungus causing thrush. It
occurs in both yeast and mycelia
forms of oral cavity and infected
tissue. Candida species are
normal inhabitants of the oral
flora. Concentration is 200-500
cells per ml of saliva. Carrier state
is more in diabetics. The wearing
of removal prosthetic appliances
may also become asymptomatic
carrier. Predisposing factors
include – after administration of
antibiotics, irritant dentures, long
term consumption of cortisone,
pregnancy, old age, AIDS and
low immunity.

Thumb and digit sucking
is
defined as placement of the
thumb or more fingers in varying
depths into the mouth. Thumb
and digit sucking is one of the
commonest seen habit in children.
Recent studies have shown that
thumb sucking may be practiced
even during intrauterine life. The
presence of this habit until the age
31/2-4 years is considered
normal. Persistence of the habit
beyond this age can lead to
various malocclusions.

Thymol
is relatively a weak
antiseptic. It is widely used as
mouth washes. It has a good
flavor.

Thymus
is a primary lymphoid
organ, bilobed structure located
in the thorax anterior to the
sternum. Histologically, each lobe
contains lobules separated by
connective tissue trabaculae. Each
lobule is made up of an outer
cortex with immature cells.
Hassal Corpuscles in thymic
medulla are containing degenerating
suspected cells.

Thyroglossal tract cyst
arises from
remnants of thyroglossal duct and
may develop anywhere along the
embryonic thyroglossal tract
between the foramen coecum of
tongue and thyroid gland. It
consists squamous and glandular
epithelium. It generally develops
in young person. It raises from a
few mm to a few centimetres. It
is asymptomatic and grows
slowly. If large, it may cause
dysphagia. Occasionally fistula
may form.

Thyroid storm
is a medical
emergency. Fever may go up to
41° C with anxiety, tremor,
weakness, heat intolerance,
sweating and weight loss. Sinus
tachycardia is always present.
Atrial fibrillation develops.
Reflexes become brisk.

Tic Doloreux
where Tic is spasm
and Dolor is the Latin word for
pain. Because trigeminal
neuralgia pain comes as electrical
shock, each pain spasm is called
tic doloreux.

Tics
are a sudden rapid twitch like
movement always of same nature
and same type. These are generally
common in childhood and
disappear in adult life. All forms
of tics can be suppressed clinically.

Tin oxide
is a pure white powder
that is used as a final polishing
agent. Tine oxide is mixed with
water alcohol or glycerine and is
used as a paste. Finishing
abrasives are coarse, hard
particles and polishing abrasives
are fine articles.

Tissue borne passive appliance
are
mostly located in the vestibule
and have little or no contact with
the dentition e.g. functional
regulator or Frankel.

Tissue Health Index
was
developed by Sheiham A.,
Maizels J. and Maizels A., at the
second alternative indices, which
is a modification of the DMFT
index. In the THI, selective
weighting is given for Decayed,
Filled and Sound teeth (i.e. ‘1’ -
Decayed, ‘2’ - Filled and ‘4’ -
Sound).

Tissue repair
is a process following
inflammation white cells repair
by filling the breach with a
temporary repair called granulation
tissue. New capillaries are
formed, but repair cannot take
place in presence of pus. Hence
tooth requires extraction or root
treatment to drain off pus.

Titanium
is a material of choice
because of its good biocompatibility,
mechanical properties and
in implantology, its proven ability
to achieve osseointegration.

T-Lymphocytes
precursor arise
from bone marrow stem cell, the
T-lymphocytes travel to the
thymus where they mature.
T-lymphocytes mediate cellular
immunity and is important for
defence against virus, fungi and
bacteria. They play an important
role in regulating immune
system. Thymus is large in
children and shrinks as an individual
matures. Different types of
T-cells have different functions.
Some are memory cells. Some are
T-helper cells increasing the
function of B lymphocytes and
increases the antibody response.
Others are called T-suppress or
cells decreasing the function of B
lymphocytes. T-killer cells are
active in vigilance against tumor
or virally affected cells.

Tobacco chewer’s
white lesion
develops where the tobacco is
placed. Mucobuccal fold is the most
common location. Epithelium gives
a wrinkled appearance. There is a
risk of malignancy with long
exposure to tobacco.

Tobacco stains
appear as light
brown to dark brown or black.
They may appear in various
forms such as - Narrow crest
following the gingival contour,
Wide band extending from the
cervical third to the middle third
of the tooth and diffuse they are
primarily present on the cervical
third of the tooth but may involve
any surface including pits and
fissures and the lingual surface.
These stains are generally formed
from the smokeless tobacco and
are mainly composed of tar and
combustion products. The heavy
deposits may penetrate the
enamel and present as endogenous
stains.

Tolerance
occurs when the
immune system is constantly
exposed to self Ag (antigen)
without inducing lymphocyte
stimulation ‘self tolerance’. It is a
result of several mechanisms
designed to distinguish between
lymphocytes with potential to
bind to self components and those
with much higher binding
specificity for antigenic
determinants expressed by
foreign Ag.

Tongue brushing
is an act
involving cleaning of tongue that
should be combined with tooth
brushing. Dorsum of the tongue
is a primary source of infection.
Tongue brushing can reduce the
number of these organisms. It
improves patient’s taste perception
also. Tongue should remain
free of coating or debris. But
tongue may not be scrubbed with
tooth brush.

Tongue papillae
are the samll
elevations present on dorsal
surface of tongue. These are of
variable size and represent
different type of taste sensation.
These can be classified into four
types. (i) Filliform papillae – are
numerous white hair like
projection that covers the dorsal
surface (ii) circumvallate papillae
on tongue in a V formation on
dorsal surface. It contains bitter
taste buds. (iii) Foliate papillae are
projection found on posterior
lateral borders of tongue and
consist of sour and acidic taste
buds. (iv) Fungiform papillae
among filliform papillae on the
dorsal surface of tongue. These
consists sweet, sour and salty
buds.

Tongue thrust
habit is defined as a
condition in which the tongue
makes contact with any teeth
anterior to the molars during
swallowing. Tongue thrust is a
forward placement of the tongue
between the anterior teeth and
against the lower lip during
swallowing (Schneider 1982) is an
act of swallowing as the placement
of the tongue tip forward
between the incisors during
swallowing (Profit 1990) or is an
oral habit pattern related to the
persistence of an infantile
swallow pattern during childhood
and adolescence and
thereby produces an open bite
and protrusion of the anterior
tooth segments (Barber, 1975).

Tongue thrusting corrector appliance (Viazis, 1993)
consists
of a palatal wire that is inserted
in the upper lingual molar
sheaths, passes through the openbite
area, and carries over the
lower incisors toward the labial
vestibule, ending 1-2 mm above
the labial surface. ‘U’- shaped
palatal loops are used to adjust
the appliance in an anteroposterior
or vertical direction with a
three -prong plier. The TCA can
also be expanded, like a palatal
expansion appliance, to correct
the posterior cross bites that often
accompany open bites. It does not
contact the teeth or the soft tissue.
The TCA is designed to keep the
patient from inserting the thumb
in the mouth, and it prevents
tongue thrusting or abnormal
tongue posturing during swallowing
by blocking the tongue from
the anterior teeth. This in turn
helps close the open bite.

Tonic seizure
there is a tonic
contraction of muscle with altered
consciousness but no clonic
phase. These generally occur
during NREM sleep with day
drowsiness.

Tonsillitis
is a common bacterial
upper respiratory tract infection.
Patients will complaint of sore
throat with dysphagia. Child is not
able to eat food. Pain and fever
accompanies. There develops
leucocytosis. Amoxicillin and
analgesic anti-inflammatory drugs
help.

Tooth ankylosis
can be defined as
fusion of tooth root to the
underlying bone more often after
an injury. Periapical inflammation
is a well recognised cause of
it by way of root absorption. If
more of root surface is involved
it may give a dull, muffed sound
on percussion instead of normal
sharp sound. It may be visible on
radiograph there will be loss of
normal thin radiolucent line with
mild sclerosis of bone. There is no
treatment. It serves well unless
infected.

Tooth banks
are several banks to
store tooth with different
techniques such as chemical
coagulation, vitrification, freeze
drying and regular freezing.

Tooth borne active appliance
includes
modification of activator
and bionator that include expansion
screws or other active components
like spring to provide
intrinsic force to transverse or
anteroposterior changes.

Tooth borne passive appliance
are
those appliances that have no
intrinsic force generating
components such as spring or
screw. They depend on the soft
tissues stretch and muscular
activity to produce the desired
treatment results. e.g. activator,
bionator and herbst appliance.

Tooth brush filaments
are the
nylon filaments that are superior
to natural bristles made of hog or
boar hair. Nylon filaments flex 10
times more than breaking. These
are more resistant to accumulation
of bacteria and fungi. Soft
nylon filaments are less traumatic
to gingival tissues. Range of nylon
filament diameter is 0.15 mm to
0.4 mm. Most bristles are 10 to
12 mm long. Thickness any from
0.007 to 0.12 mm are considered
medium and 0.013 to 0.015 mm
are classified as hard. End of the
tooth brush filament can be cut
bluntly or rounded. Round cut
edges reduce gingival abrasion.

Tooth brushing
is an act of cleaning
done domestically after meals to
removes plaque. Tooth brushes
with a small head and multi
tufted medium nylon bristles are
most effective. Brushed in rinsed
and pea size portion of fluoride
tooth paste is added. Effective
tooth brushing required time,
knowledge and skill.

Tooth eruption
is the process by
which developing teeth emerge
through the soft tissue of the jaws
and the overlying mucosa to enter
the oral cavity, contact the teeth
of the opposing arch, and
function in mastication (see Figure
on page 454).

Tooth fracture
is a common injury
occuring due to trauma. It may
occur at any age but children
between the age of 2-3 yrs are
most commonly affected. Minor
chipping is common. Fracture has
been classified in many ways.
Prognosis depends whether pulp
is involved, or crown/root is
involved. If dentin over pulp is
thin bacteria may penetrate
producing pulpitis. Fractured
crown is a more serious problem
if the pulp is exposed.

Tooth surface index of fluorosis (TSIF)
is a index that was
developed to measure the extent
of fluorosis. TSIF was developed
by Herschel S Horowitz, William
S Driscoll, Rhea J Meyers, Stanley
B Heifeta, and Albert Knigman in
1984. TSIF was developed in
order to eliminate or reduce some
of the short comings of ‘Deans
Index’. TSIF was applied in a
survey to assess the prevalence of
dental caries and dental fluorosis
in communities having optimal
and above optimal concentrations
of naturally occurring fluoride in
the drinking water.

Tooth wear
is a mechanical process
that occurs due to aging. It is an
increasing problem in older
adults due to long period of
functioning. It has 3 causes
abrasion, attrition and erosion.
Reduction in lubricating effect of
saliva may cause it.

Tooth zones
are divided into
imaginary third, named
according to areas in which they
are found. Root of tooth is divided
into apical, middle and cervical
third. Crown of the tooth is
divided into cervico occlusal
division, mesio distal division and
buccolingual division.

Topical
is application directly to an
affected area for treatment.

Topical anesthesia
is a medicament
that eliminates sensation on
surface tissues such as skin and
mucosa. Oral mucosa can be
anesthetized by wiping a topical
anesthetic which will reduce the
discomfort of dental injections,
etc.

Topical fluoride
is applied to the
teeth but not ingested.

Topography
is detailed description
and analysis of features of an
anatomic region.

Toronto automated probe
is a
diagnostic probe to measure
clinical attachment levels. Here
the sulcus is probed with the Ni-Ti
wire that is extended under air
pressure.

Torus mandibularis
is an
outgrowth of bone on the lingual
surface of mandible opposite
bicuspid tooth. These may be
multiple and on both sides. It may
be removed surgically.

Torus palatinus
is slowly growing,
flat base bone protuberance. It
generally occurs in mid line of
hard palate. Women are affected
more. On trauma it becomes
ulcerated. It never becomes
malignant. It is not treated.

Toxic
refer to Poisonous.

Toxic myocarditis
occurs due to
drugs that cause a direct toxic
injury to the myocardial fibres.
Response is cumulative and dose
related. In this group drugs
include arsenicals, catecholamines,
lithium, cyclophosphamide
emetine etc. Healing occurs
by fibrosis.

Toxic shock syndrome
is a
multisystem illness caused by
endotoxins produced by stains of
staphylococcus aureus. Symptoms
include fever, chills,
diarrhea, dizziness, headache,
myalgias and sore throat. Patient
may develop hypotension with
desquamation of skin.

Toxicology
is the study of toxic and
harmful effects of drugs and
chemicals. It deals with the
science of knowledge of sources,
characters, properties and symptoms
of poisons, their fatal effects,
the lethal doses and remedies to
be taken to counteract the effect.

Toxin
is any poisonous substance
of microbial, vegetable or animal
origin that causes symptoms after
a period of incubation. It can
induce the elaboration of specific
antitoxin in suitable animal.

Trabecular bone
is similar to
cortical bone but with spongy
look. It is composed of rods and
sheets of bone.

Tracheostomy
is the term given to
the surgical establishment of an
opening in to the trachea. It is
usually performed electively
when the endotracheal intubation
is likely to extend beyond 14 days.
The opening is made in the
anterior wall of trachea. It is done
to have alternate pathway for
breathing, improves alveolar
ventilation, to give anesthesia.

Traction vertebral spurs
projects
horizontally and develops 1-2 mm
above the vertebral edge. It is also
known as Macnab spur. It is the
small traction spur that is
symptomatic.

Traditional alloy
contains silver 66
to 72% by weight, tin 25-29%,
copper 2 to 6%. Zinc 2% and
mercury 3% by weight.

Tragus
is the cartilaginous projection
anterior to external opening
of the ear.

Tramadol
is an analgesic with both
opioid as well as non opioid
actions. It works like aspirin as
well as like morphine. High doses
of it should be avoided. It is used
in the dose of 50-100 mg daily.

Tranquillizers
are the drugs which
decrease anxiety and tension
without producing sedation.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
also termed incipient stroke,
transient cerebral ischemia is
characterized by ischemic
cerebral neurologic deficits that
last for less than 24 hours. These
attacks rarely last more than 8
hours and often resolve within 15-
60 mins. Platelet, fibrin or other
atherosclerotic embolic material
from the neck or heart may lodge
in a cerebral vessel and interfere
transiently with blood flow
causing the TIA.

Translocation
is the change in
position.

Translucency
is the amount of
incident light transmitted and
scattered by that object. Translucency
decreases with increasing
scattered within materials. A high
translucency gives a lighter color
appearance. Translucency
decreases with increasing
scattering with in a material.

Translucent lesion
are demonstrating
translucent quality and are
bullae or vesicle. Translucent pink
lesions are due to accumulation
of clear fluid such as serum,
mucin or lymph. Blue translucent
lesion indicates clear fluid or
blood accumulation. Red or
purple translucent lesion
indicates blood accumulation.

Transmissible
is the term which
denotes a capacity of a lesion to
maintain an infectious agent in
successive passages through a
susceptible host.

Transmission
refers to the spread
of disease from one person to
another by various model such as
saliva air, contact with
contaminated instrument etc. of
disease through saliva is low.
Herpes virus may secrete into
saliva. Coxsakie virus is also a
latent infection and has a risk of
transmission of virus through
dental clinic.

Transosseous wiring
is a type of
intermaxillary fixation with
osteosynthesis where direct
wiring is done across the fracture
line in order to achieve effective
immobilization of the fracture of
the body of the mandible
including angle. The holes are
drilled in the bone ends of both
the sides of the fracture line and
the soft stainless steel wire is
passed through the holes across
the fracture. After achieving the
accurate reduction the free ends
of the wires are twisted together
and tucked in to a nearest hole.
Achieving osteosynthesis by
wiring has an advantage of
requiring minimal equipment
and can be used for many types
of mandibular fractures.

Transplantation of organs
refers to
a removal of a viable and healthy
organ and placing it into another
body where the existing organ
has become diseased or dysfunctional
e.g. heart, kidney, brain and
liver. The viability or transplantable
organs falls sharply after
somatic death such as liver must
be taken out within 15 minutes, a
kidney within 45 minutes and a
heart within an hour. After
molecular death it is not feasible.

Transseptal fibres
are those fibres
which extend interproximally
over the alveolar bone crest and
get embedded into the cementum
of the adjacent tooth. These fibers
can be considered as a part of
gingival fibers as they lack
osseous attachment.

Transverse ridge
is a linear
elevation that crosses a surface
(usually the occlusal surface).

Trauma from occlusion (TFO)
can
be described as when occlusal
forces exceed the adaptive
capacity or margins of safety of
the tissues, it results in tissue
injury. This resultant injury is
known as trauma from occlusion.

Traumatic cyst
is not a true cyst not
being lined by epithelium.
Expansion ceases when cyst like
lesion reaches the cortical layer of
bone. When roots are involved
cavity may become scalloped. A
thin connective tissue lines the
cavity. X-ray shows smoothly
outlined radiolucent area of
variable size with in sclerotic
border.

Traumatic fibroma
refers to
fibroma.

Traumatic neuroma
is not a true
neoplasm but is an exuberant try
to repair a damaged nerve trunk.
It is a hyperplasia of nerve fibers
and supporting tissue. Degeneration
of distal nerve after injury
begins with swelling, fragmentation
and disintegration of myelin
sheath and axis cylinder. Oral
neuroma begins with small
nodule or swelling of mucosa
near mental foramen. Treatment
includes surgical excision of
nodule along with small proximal
portion of nerve involved.

Traumatic occlusion
is the term
used when the injury is produced
by the occlusion.

Traumatic ulcer
results due to
physical injury such as denture
irritation, an ill fitting denture or
biting of the mucosa. Traumatic
ulcers are usually single of
variable size and round in shape.
The floor will be yellow with red
margins and there will not be any
induration. It is covered by a
white or tan fibrin clot and
generally located at lateral
border. It can be painful.
Recurrent trauma can make it
firm and elevated with rolled
borders. After removing the
cause ulcer may heal within 1-2
days, occasionally ulcers persist
for long. Traumatic ulcers may be
accidental or deliberate biting or
thermal burns from hot pasty
foods.

Treatment contract
is the
understanding between doctor
and patient which includes
frequency, number and duration
of treatment.

Treatment index
The ‘F (filled)
portion of the DMF Index best
exemplifies a treatment index. In
general, there are two types of
dental indices. This type of dental
index measures the ‘number’ of
people affected and the ‘severity’
of the specific condition at a
specific time or interval of time.

Treatment manual
is a written
material that identifies key
concepts, procedure and tactic to
treat a person.

Treatment plan
is known as blue
print for case management. It
includes all the procedures
required for the maintenance of
oral health.

Tremor
is the rhythmic oscillation
of part of body around a fixed
point. Tremors usually involve
distal part of limb, head, tongue
and rarely trunk. Tremors at rest
even in lying supine are seen in
parkinsonism. Essential tremors
occur in anxiety, fatigue and due
to alcohol while intentional
tremors are seen in phenytoin
toxicity, multiple sclerosis and in
cerebellar disease.

Tremor of Parkinsonism
consists
of a rapid, rhythmic, alternating
tremor. Pill rolling tremors are
seen. It is usually unilateral.

Trench mouth
refers acute
necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.

Trichloroethylene
is a colorless
volatile liquid with chloroform
like smell. It is colored blue to
avoid confusion with chloroform.
It has a poor relaxation of skeletal
muscles. It has good analgesic
properties but induction and
recovery are poor. Bradycardia
and cardiac arrhythmias may
occur.

Trichodento-osseous syndrome
shows enamel defects in
conjunction with morphologic
dental anomalies. These patients
have tightly curled kinky hair
with osteosclerosis of bone
cortices. The enamel is hypoplastic
and hypocalcified, lacking
mesiodistal contact with pitting.

Triclosan
is a non-cationic
antibacterial agent and has been
added to several dentifrices to
inhibit plaque and gingivitis. It
has good antibacterial activity
against Gram positive and Gram
negative organisms and is
compatible with anionic component
of fluoride dentifrices. Two
clinical studies over a 3-month
period by Schiff et al (1990) and
Lobene et al (1990) showed a
statistically significant reduction
of plaque formation.

Tricuspid regurgitation
is common
and most frequently occuring as
a result of right ventricular
dialatations. It may occur with
right ventricular and inferior
myocardial infarction. Symptoms
and signs of tricuspid regurgitation
are identical to those
resulting from right ventricular
failure of any cause. Symptoms
are usually non specific and relate
to reduced forward flow and
venous congestion pansystolic
murmur and systolic pulsation of
liver.

Tricuspid stenosis
is usually rheumatic
in origin. It is suspected
when right heart failure is marked
with liver enlargement, ascites
and dependent edema. Acquired
tricuspid stenosis needs valvotomy.

Trifurcation
is forked or divided
into three parts.

Trigeminal nerve
is a fifth cranial
nerve that contains both sensory
and motor fibres. It is the largest
and has 3 branches –(i) Ophthalmic
nerve is purely sensory and
is the smallest division. It divides
into three branches lacrimal,
frontal and nasociliary nerve. It
supplies cornea, skin of forehead,
scalp, eyelids, nose and also the
mucus membrane of paranasal
sinuses.(ii) Maxillary branch is
purely sensory. It leaves the skull
through foramen rotundum. It
supplies skin over face over
maxilla and the upper lip, teeth
of upper jaw, mucus membrane
of nose, maxillary air sinus and
palate. (iii) Mandibular division
is a mixed branch and is the
largest branch. Motor part
supplies muscles of mastication.
Sensory supply is to skin of cheek,
skin over mandible, lower lip and
side of head, teeth of lower jaw,
mucus membrane of mouth and
anterior 2/3rd of tongue.

Trigeminal neuralgia
is the most
painful affliction of mankind. A
single branch may be affected
without affecting other branch. It
is an intermittent brief, laminating
pain in face. It is evoked by facial
movement or by touching the
skin. Pain is sudden, excruciating
and brief like the stabbing.
Peripheral receptors are not
hyperalgesic. Pain does not
extend outside area supplied by
trigeminal nerve. The trigger may
occur from light touch or
movement of same receptor
areas. Pain is usually unilateral
and remains in the anatomical
distribution of affected nerve.
Typically individual pains are
paroxysms of hot, shocking,
burning or electric like lasting
from a few seconds to several
minutes. They may be repeated so
frequently that pain becomes
continuous. Paresthesia and
motor symptoms are generally
absent. No sensory loss is
detected. No specific cause is
known. Progressive degeneration
and demyelination of trigeminal
ganglion is seen. Secondary
trigeminal neuralgia can result
due to intracranial tumor, and
vascular malformation, CNS
lesions involving trigeminal
pathways. Trigeminal neuralgia
due to multiple sclerosis may
have bilateral facial pain. There
may be hypoesthesia too. In both
cases carbamazpiene and GABA
are used. Phenytoin in doses of
400 mg/day reduces the dose of
carbamazepiene.

Trismus
is a spasm of the muscles
of mastication that results in
difficulty in opening of mouth.
Intraoral injections may result it.

Triturate
is to mix together.

Trochlear nerve
is a motor nerve,
cranial nerve number four. It
assists in turning eye ball downward
and laterally. It emerges
from posterior surface of mid brain.
It enters the orbit through the
superior orbital fissure (see Figure).

Tropic ulcer
is found at anaesthetic
sites. Injury may be mechanical
and thermal. First and fifth
metatarsals are commonly
affected. There may be
spontaneous blister or nodule.
Ulcer may become infected. Deep
tissues and bone may be
involved. Floor of ulcer is covered
by brownish tenacious and foul
swelling slough. Surrounding
skin is edematous regional lymph
nodes may be enlarged and
tender.

True oral malodor Halitosis
is most
often a consequence of oral
bacterial activity typically arising
from anaerobes due to poor oral
hygiene, gingivitis (ANUG),
periodontal disease, infected
extraction sockets, oral sepsis,
residual blood postoperatively,
debris under fixes or removable
appliances, ulcers and dry mouth.

Tubercle
is a small, rounded
projection.

Tuberculin test
was discovered by
Von Pirquet in 1907. A positive
reaction to test is accepted as
evidence of past or present infection
by M Tuberculosis. It is done
to test in population.

Tuberculin type hypersentivity
was originally, described by Koch
in patients with TB who had fever
and generalized sickness, following
a spontaneous injection of
tuberculin, a lipoprotein antigen
from tubercle bacillus. 12 hrs after
Intradermal tuberculosis
challenge, T-lymphocytes are
present at perivascular sites and
this infiltrate, which extends
outwards and disrupts the
collagen bundles of the dermis
increases to a peak at 48 hrs. Cells
of the macrophage lineage are
probably the main APCs in
tuberculin hypersensitivity. As the
lesion develops, it may become a
granulomatous reaction.

Tuberculoid leprosy
has well
defined skin lesions with raised
margins and healing centers are
characteristic of tuberculoid
leprosy. These lesions are
anesthetic to touch and pin prick.
The leprae are usually not
detected on skin smear examination.
Microscopically lesion
shows collections of epitheloid
cells and Langerhan’s type giant
cell. Caseation is usually absent.
Temperature sensation is first to
be affected followed by pressure,
touch and pain. Margins of
lesions are elevated and
superficial. Larger nerves closer
to skin are enlarged. Neuritic
pain, muscle dystrophy, contracture
and trauma from pressure
and burns are common.

Tuberculosis
is a granulomatous
disease caused by acid fast
bacillus. Patient may suffer from
evening fever, fatigue, malaise
and loss of weight. Spread is
through blood or lymph TB of
submaxillary and cervical lymph
nodes may progress to the actual
abscess. Glands are enlarged.
Lesions of oral mucosa are
seldom primary but secondary to
pulmonary disease. Tongue is
most commonly affected. Lesion
is irregular, superficial or deep,
painful ulcer which increases
slowly. Mucosal lesions show
swelling or fissuring. Tuberculous
gingivitis is an unusual
form of tuberculosis which
produces hyperaemic, nodular or
proliferative gingiva. Diffuse
involvement of maxilla or
mandible may occur (see Figure
on page 462).

Tuberculous lymphadenitis
is a
condition where cervical glands
are commonly affected. Route
may be via tonsils or oral mucosa.
There will be a lump in neck. It is
painful. In early stage swelling is
firm and mobile. Later the mass
becomes fixed. Lesion may be
unilateral, bilateral single or
multiple (see Figure).

Tuberculous meningitis
may
develop as a consequence of
miliary TB. Human tubercular
bacilli are responsible. Prodromal
symptoms include lassitude,
weight loss and anorexia. Diffuse
headache and neck stiffness
develops. Mild fever appears.
Patient assumes a flexed position.
Tuberculous lymph node showing
dystrophic calcification
Tuberculous lymphadenitis
Tuberculous osteomyelitis
CSF pressure is raised. On long
standing ‘cob web’ is formed. CSF
sugar is low. Treatment is to begin
with 3 anti TB drugs. Total duration
of treatment is 6-9 month.

Tuberculous ulcer
is caused by
mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is
an aerobic, slender, non motile,
non spore forming, rod shaped
organism. Most of people get
infection in first year of life.
Primary infection usually takes
place in lungs. Hemoptysis,
abundant sputum and pleuritic
pain are very common. Tuberculous
lesions of the oral cavity
are secondary to pulmonary
infections. Important oral lesions
are tuberculous ulcers, tuberculous
gingivitis, tuberculous
osteomyelitis and tuberculosis of
salivary gland. For tongue ulcers
it is the most common site of
occurrence. On lateral borders
these appear either single or
multiple lesions. On palate these
may appear as small ulcer or
granuloma. Lesions often
produced are small, granulating
ulcers at the mucocutaneous
junction. Gingival lesions of
tuberculosis usually produce
granulating ulcers or erosive
lesions with gingival hyperplasia.

Tuberosity
is a large, rounded
projection.

Tuberous sclerosis
is an autosomal
dominant multisystem disorder
of neuroectodermal origin.
Presenting feature is mental
deficiency with epilepsy. Seizures
develop in first decade of life.
Mental retardation may be noted.
Radiograph shows intracranial
calcification with generalized
thickening and hyperostosis of
cranial vault. Multiple cortical
tubers are classical findings.
Metacarpals and phalanges may
show subperiosteal irregular new
bone formation. Small well
defined cysts are seen.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
shares many of its biological
activities i.e. Pro-inflammatory
properties, MMP stimulation, and
bone resorption with IL-1. In
addition, it’s secretion by
monocytes and fibroblast is
stimulated by bacterial Lipopolysaccharide.

Tumors of brain stem
present with
unilateral or bilateral paralysis of
cranial nerves. Crossed
hemiplegia, hemianesthesia and
cerebellar symptoms develop.

Turkey tests
include multiple
comparison procedure.

Turku sugar studies
were a series
of collaborative studies carried
out in Turku, Finland, by
Scheinin, Makinen et al. They
were investigated by a
comprehensive program including
clinical, radiographic,
biochemical, and micro-biochemical
determinants of health.
In addition to the massive data
indicating that xylitol would be
an acceptable metabolite in
humans, there was a dramatic
reduction in the incidence of
dental caries after two years of
xylitol consumption. Subsequently
a 1-year chewing gum study
was conducted on 102 subjects
who consumed the xylitol or
sucrose chewing gum but
otherwise pursued their usual
dietary and oral hygiene habits.

Turner’s spot
is an enamel
hypoplasia of permanent tooth as
a result of local trauma or infection
of a deciduous tooth.
Infection restricts work of
ameloblasts and results in poorly
formed enamel.

Tweed’s method
is one of the
method of performing serial
extractions. It involves the extraction
of the first molars around
8 years of age. This is followed by
the extraction of the first premolars
and the deciduous canine.

Twitch
is the contraction of a
muscle in response to a single
action potential.

Type I hypersensitivity
is characterized
by an allergic reaction
immediately following contact
with an antigen referred to as an
allergen. Allergy (coined by Von-
Pirquet in 1906) is defined as the
changed reactivity of the host
when meeting an agent. In recent
years allergy has become synonymous
with Type I hypersensitivity.
Dependent on the specific
triggering of IgE sensitized mast
cells by antigen, resulting in the
release of pharmacological
mediators of inflammation.

Typhoid
is caused by Salmonella
Typhi. The infection gets localized
to small intestine. To start person
may have headache, general body
ache and malaise. Fever rises in
step ladder fashion. Temperature
increases every day especially in
the evening. In morning fever
comes down but never touches
normal. It happens for 7-10 days.
During the second stage patient
usually looks very ill. Tongue is
coated with clean tip. There will
be relative bradycardia. During
third week patient starts looking
better. During acute stage, the
organisms would be positive in
first week and urine, stool culture
becomes positive by second
week. Widal test is positive
during second week.

Tzanck cells
are the epithelial cells
which shows ballooning degeneration,
consisting of acantholysis,
nuclear clearing and nuclear
enlargement. This is a histologic
feature and can be appreciated
only at a microscopic level.

Ulcer
is a pathological
condition in which there
is a breakdown of
epithelial tissue. There is
a full thickness loss of
surface epithelium with
exposure to underlying
connective tissue. In
mouth ulcers are usually
painful, except malignant one
which may be initially painless.
Biopsy is needed if ulcer is not
responding for more than 3
weeks.

Ulceration colitis
is a disease of
young people between the age of
15-25 years. Symptoms range
from small amount of rectal
bleeding to prominent diarrhea
and colonic hemorrhage with
prostration. It may manifest as
spondylitis, peripheral arthritis,
iritis and skin disorders.
Rectosigmoid colon is commonly
involved.

Ultimate strength
is the maximum
stress a solid can support based
on its original cross section area.

Ultrasonic cleaning
is the
loosening and removal of debris
from instruments by sound
waves travelling through a
chemical solution. It has increased
U efficiency in cleaning and has
reduced danger of aerosolization
of infectious particles released
during scrubbing. Injury to
instrument is lesser and is an easy
process.

Ultrasonic
is the conversion of high
frequency electrical current into
mechanical vibrations. Ultrasonic
is the use of sound waves for
detection and this offers
considerable potential as a
diagnostic instrument. Ultrasonic
imaging was introduced by Ng et
al. (1988) as a method for
detecting early caries in smooth
surfaces. With the use of this
instrumentation, sonic velocity
and specific acoustic impedance
can be determined for the dentin
and enamel as well as for the soft
tissue and bone.

Ultrasonic scaler
is an electronically
powered device that
produces vibratory motions to
dislodge deposits from teeth.
Commonly used scalers operate
in the 5000 to 7000 cycles/second
range. Most magnetostrictive
ultrasonic operate at 25000-30000
cycles per second while piezo
electric ultrasonic operates at
40000 to 50000 cycles/second.

Ultrasonic scaling
is a use of an
ultrasonic scaler to remove
mineralized deposits from tooth
surface.
Ultrasound
Upper limit of
hearing is 20 KHz (20,000 cycles
per second). Ultrasound is very
much above this therapeutic
frequencies being in the region of
1 MHz to 3 MHz.

Uncontrolled diabetes
Oral
manifestations include multiple
periodontal abscesses, velvety red
gingival and marginal
proliferation of the periodontal
tissues.

Undercut
is the portion of tooth
lying between the height and
contour of gingiva.

Under cut cavity preparation
We
know that permanent filling
canont be inserted directly into a
cavity and preparation of cavity
is required so that filling may not
comeout.

Undermining resorption
is the
term used when the bone loss
occurs from a healthy or viable
periodontal ligament which is
present adjacent to the necrotic
areas.

Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells
are the stem cells located in
the cell-rich zone and the pulp
proper which can differentiate
into odontoblasts and / or
fibroblasts.

Unfavorable fractures
are the one
where the vertical fracture or the
horizontal fracture lines are
opposed by the action of the
muscle around them. However,
these types of fractures are not so
easy to reduce and stabilize.

Unicystic Ameloblastoma
There
will be localized thinning and
haziness of radiopaque rim. It
generally occurs before the age of
30. Lesion slowly enlarges due to
expansion of cortex. On palpation
it is hard and bony.

Unilateral condylar neck fractures
are the fractures involving the
neck of the condyle and are of two
types: low condylar neck
fractures and high condylar neck
fractures. If the fracture is
undisplaced, no active treatment
is required but in case of
displaced fractures, dislocation
will induce malocclusion. A low
neck fracture can be treated by
open reduction and a high
condylar neck fracture with
extensive displacement and
malocclusion, intermaxillary
fixation (IMF) is done for up to
3-4 weeks and maintained until
bony union has occurred.

Unilateral extracapsular fractures
refers to unilateral condylar neck
fractures.

Unilateral fracture
usually ours on
one side of the body but
occasionally more than one
fracture may be present. It is
generally caused by direct
violence.

Unilateral intracapsular fractures
are the fractures occurring in the
condyle. In these cases the
occlusion is usually undisturbed
and fracture should be treated
conservatively. If malocclusion
occurs the intermaxillary fixation
(IMF) for 2-3 weeks is indicated.

Universal curettes
are the one
which can be used in most areas
of the dentition by altering and
adapting the finger rest and hand
position of the operator. The
blades of these curettes are
curved in one direction.

Universal/National Numbering System
is approved by the
American Dental Association in
1968. Most commonly used
throughout the United States. The
permanent teeth are numbered
from 1 to 32. Numbering begins
with the upper right third molar,
works around to the upper left
third molar, drops to the lower
left third molar, and works
around to the lower right third
molar. In the Universal
Numbering System, the primary
teeth are lettered with capital
letters from A to T.

Upper lip prominence
A line is
drawn from subnasale (Sn) to
soft-tissue pogonion (Pog’). The
most prominent point of the
upper lip (Ls) should be 3 ± 1mm
anterior to this line.

Upper lip-lower lip-chin prominence
is a vertical reference line
drawn through subnasale (SnV)
perpendicular to the true
horizontal. The upper lip should
be 1 to 2 mm ahead of this line.
The lower lip should be on the
line or 1 mm posterior to it. The
chin (Pog’) should fall within 1 to
4 mm posterior to SnV.
Alternatively the distance from
soft-tissue chin to a line
perpendicular to FH through soft
tissue nasion can be measured.
This is also known as 0-degree
meridian and Pog’ is estimated to
be 0 ± 2 mm from this line.

Uremic syndrome
Early symptom
of kidney failure is decreased
creatinine clearance. As disease
progresses glomerular filtration
rate falls and blood urea nitrogen
rises. Person may develop
impaired ability to concentrate
urine, nocturia and mild anemia.
Advanced uremia is associated
with pericarditis, pericardial
effusion and neuropathies.

Ureter
is a duct that transmits urine
from kidney to bladder.

Urgency of urine
is the sudden
desire to void. It is seen in
inflammatory conditions i.e.
cystitis or neurogenic bladder.

Uric acid
is the end product of
purine metabolism.

Uricosuric drugs
are those drugs
that block tubular reabsorption of
filtered urate and reduce the
metabolic pool of urates,
preventing the formation of new
tophi. When given with
colchicines these lessen the
frequency of recurrence of gout.

Urinary tract obstruction
Severe
obstruction can produce acute
anuria, burning and pain on
urination, overflow in continence
or dribbling, voiding of small
amount and flank pain. In
secondary infection fever, chills
malaise develop along with foul
smelling urine.

Urine pregnancy test
is a test that
depends on the presence of human
chorionic gonadotrophin in urine.
Usually a concentration of about
2500 I.V. HCG per liter of urine is
required to register a positive
health. It usually occurs 12 days
after the first missed period.

Urticaria
results when antigen
reaches specific skin areas causing
localized anaphylactic reaction.
Histamine on release results in red
flare and increased permeability of
capillaries resulting in swelling
within a few minutes.

Useful habits
include habits that
are considered essential for
normal function such as proper
positioning of the tongue, respiration
and normal deglutition.

Uterine fibroids
These are uterine
leiomyoma. If large it produces a
round, multinodular mass in
suprapubic region. She may feel
heaviness in abdomen and
pressure on surrounding organs
with frequency of urine.
Menorrhagia develops. Edema
and varicosities of lower
extremities result.

Utilitarian ethics
is an ethical
theory based on the principle of
the greatest good for the majority.

Uvula
is a small muscular structure
located on the free edge of soft
palate. When you swallow the
food it prevents your food from
coming out of your nose. It directs
the food down the throat into
esophagus.

Vaccination
is used to
produce acquired
immunity. Person can
be vaccinated by injecting
dead organisms
which are no longer
capable of causing
disease but still have
chemical antigen. These
are used against
typhoid, diphtheria, whooping
cough and diphtheria. Secondly
immunity can be achieved against
toxins which have been treated
with chemicals. These are used
against tetanus and botulinism.
Thirdly person can be vaccinated
by infecting him with live
organism that has been attenuated.
These are used against polio,
measles and other viral diseases.

Vagus nerve
is a mixed tenth
cranial nerve. Motor part supplies
pharynx and larynx, bronchi and
heart. Sensory fibres carry taste
from epiglottis and vellecula.

Validity
is the meaningfulness of
test scores as they are used for
specific tests.

Van Limborgh’s Theory
is a multifactorial
theory put forward by
Van Limborgh in 1970. According
to van Limborgh, the three
popular theories of growth were
not satisfactory, yet each contains
elements of significance that
cannot be denied. Van Limborgh
explains the process of growth
and development in a view that
combines all the three existing
theories. He supports the functional
matrix theory of Moss,
acknowledged some aspects of
Sicher’s theory and at the same
time does not rule out genetic
involvement. Van Limborgh has
suggested the following five
factors that he believed controls
growth: intrinsic genetic factors,
local epigenetic factors, general
epigenetic factors, local environmental
factors, general environmental
factors.

Veneer crown
is a thin gold shell
used in the construction of
bridges. On back teeth it covers
the entire crown known as full
crown. On front it covers all but
the labial surface and is called
three quarter crown.

Vapour pressure
is a measure of
liquid’s tendency to evaporate.
Materials with high vapor
pressure at room temperature
tend to evaporate readily.

Varicocele
is a pampiniform plexus
of veins of the spermatic cord. It
is a consequence to venous stasis
aided by gravity forces and
prolonged standing. Intraabdominal
tumor also results
increased pressure on the
spermatic veins.

Varicose ulcer
is a chronic ulcer of
leg of insidious onset. Mostly
ulcer is on medial side of leg. It is
solitary. It is a shallow ulcer
where floor is covered by bluish
granulation tissue of pale slough.
Edges are irregular and sloping.
It is mobile on underlying bone.
Surrounding skin is swollen and
pigmented.

Varicose veins
are an abnormal
dilatation and tortousity of vein
especially in leg. In legs these are
abnormally dilated, elongated
and tortuous. Incidence increases
with age. It has familial tendency.
Increased intraluminal pressure
leads it. Affected veins are
dilated, stretched, tortuous and
nodular. There is irregular
thinning and atrophy of vein.
Thrombosis is common. Fibrosis
results in tortuousity. Intima is
thickened. Valvular defect causes
an important defect. Long
standing cases may develop
fibrosis, chronic edema and skin
pigmentation. Person feels dull,
aching heaviness or a feeling of
fatigue.

Varnishes
are used as thin layers
but don’t provide thermal
insulation. These serve to isolate
the tubule contents from the
cavity. Several applications are
needed to prevent penetration of
bacteria.

Vascular dementia
is the single
brain lesion which doesn’t lead to
dementia but affects mental
function. The most common type
of vascular dementia is caused by
multiple supra tentorial infarcts.
Hypertensive small vessel disease
produces predominant deep
white matter infarcts.

Vasculitis
describes a diverse
group of inflammatory disorder
characterized by multi organ
vessel involvement. There
develops fever, malaise, weight
loss and raised WBCs and ESR.

Vasoconstrictor drugs
i.e.
adrenaline and noradrenaline are
useful when there is an access to
the bleeding site. These are
effective in controlling the oozing
from capillaries. These are useful
in controlling gingival bleeding.
It is not useful in controlling
heavy hemorrhage because these
are diluted and washed out.

Vasodepressor syncope
refers to
sudden loss of consciousness that
usually occurs secondary to a
period of cerebral ischemia.
Predisposing factors for vasodepressor
syncope are psychogenic
factors such as fright, anxiety,
emotional stress, pain especially
sudden and unexpected, sight of
blood or surgical or other dental
instruments. Non psychogenic
factors include sitting in an
upright position which permits
blood to pool in the periphery
decreasing cerebral blood flow;
hunger from missed meal which
decrease the glucose supply to
brain, exhaustion, poor physical
condition and hot, humid
environment.

Vasomotor syncope
may be due to
excessive vagal tone or impaired
reflex control of peripheral
circulation. Common faint is
initiated by a stressful, painful or
claustrophobic experience.

Vehicle
is a substance possessing
little or no medicinal action used
as a medium to confer a suitable
consistency or form.

Vein
Blood vessel carrying blood
from periphery to heart.

Veneer
is a layer of tooth-colored
material can be porcelain,
composite, or ceramics attached
to the front of the tooth to
improve appearance. These are
bonded to enamel by means of
acid etch technique with the help
of resin.

Venous hemorrhage
Wound
bleeds with steady flow. The lost
blood is dark red or bluish. The
bleeding stops by elevating the
part above the level of heart.

Ventral surface of the tongue
is the
underside of the tongue.

Vermilion
means red.

Virgin teeth
are those teeth that are
free from decay or restorations.

Ventricular septal defect
is the
persistent opening in upper
interventricular septum due to
failure of fusion with aortic
septum. It results in blood to pass
from high pressure left ventricle
into low pressure right ventricle.
Large defects are associated with
early left ventricular failure.
Many VSD defects close
spontaneously in early childhood.

Verrucal
resembles like a wart.

Verrucous carcinoma
is diffused;
non metastasing well differentiated
malignant neoplasm. It
mostly develops in tobacco
chewing patients. It is exophytic
and papillary in nature.
Commonest site involved is
gingiva, alveolar mucosa and
buccal mucosa. Surface of the
lesion shows multiple deep clefts.
Lesion may be single or multiple
involving different parts of buccal
mucosa. Pain may develop
making chewing difficult. It
becomes rapidly fixed to
underlying bone. Regional lymph
nodes are often enlarged.
Malignant epithelial cells are
usually well differentiated. Pain
and difficulty in mastication are
chief complaints. Anaplastic
transformation occurs.

Vertebral compression fracture
it
may result due to osteoporosis by
bending, lifting, coughing or
sneezing. There develops acute,
severe pain at fracture site. Pain
may radiate anteriorly to flank.
Pain is typically worse in up right
position. Signs include spinal tenderness
over fractured spine along
with paravertebral muscle spasm.
Kyphosis and loss of height will
develop. Weakness, sensory deficits
incontinence or diminished
deep reflexes develop.

Vertebral osteophytes
occur due to
repeated damage to the posterior
joints especially lead to
degenerative changes. It is a true
osteo arthritic change and lipping
of vertebra may take place.

Vertical bone loss
is also known as
angular bone loss. It does not
occur in plane parallel to cementoenamel
junction.

Vertical defects
are those bony
defects of alveolar process which
occur in an oblique direction,
leaving a hollowed out trough in
the bone alongside the root.

Vesibulocochlear nerve
is the
eighth cranial nerve consisting of
two sets of sensory fibres vestibular
and cochlear. Vestibular fibres
are concerned with equilibrium.
Cochlear fibres are concerned
with hearing.

Vibration
Vibrations in the range
of 10 to 500 Hz may be
encountered in work of drills and
hammer. After some months the
fine blood vessels of fingers may
become increasingly sensitive to
spasm i.e. white fingers.

Vibrio cholerae
is a microorganism
that causes cholera. Their natural
habitat is water. Watery diarrhea
can be fatal. It is a gram negative
slender bacilli, comma shaped
with pointed ends. It is highly
motile with single flagellum. It is
seen under dark field microscopy.

Vimentin
is the type of filament
that is expressed in mesenchymal
cells such as fibroblasts, and in
endothelial cells. These fibres
often end at the nuclear membrane
and desmosomes. They are
closely associated with microtubules,
and they form cages
around lipid droplets in adipose
tissue.

Vincent’s angina
is an ulcerative
infection of mouth and throat
with enlarged lymph glands, pain
and fever. Streptococcal sore
throat also produces exudative
membrane in throat. Throat
becomes sore and extremely
painful. Pharynx may show
edema and reddening.

Vipeholm dental study
was a 5-
year investigation of 436 adult
inmates in a mental institution at
the Vipetional Hospital near
Lund, Sweden. The dental caries
rate in the inmates was relatively
low. The experimental design
divided the inmates into seven
groups; sugar was introduced
either at mealtime. The main
conclusions of the study were as
follows: An increase in carbohydrate
definitely increases the
caries activity. The risk of caries
is greater if the sugar is consumed
in a form that will be retained on
the surfaces of teeth.The risk of
sugar increasing caries activity is
greatest if the sugar is consumed
between meals and in a form that
tends to be retained on the
surfaces of the teeth.The increase
in caries activity varies widely
between individuals. Upon
withdrawal of the sugar-rich
foods, the increased caries activity
rapidly disappears. Caries lesions
may continue to appear despite
the avoidance of refined sugar
and maximum restrictions of
natural sugars and dietary
carbohydrate.A high concentration
of sugar in solution and its
prolonged retention of tooth
surfaces leads to increased caries
activity. The clearance time of the
sugar correlates closely with
caries activity.

Viperine snake bite
local
symptoms are persistent pain but
salivation is rare. There is no
paralysis of respiratory organs as
in cobra bite. It produces extensive
inflammation with cellulitis,
discoloration and incessant
oozing of hemolysed blood from
the punctured point. Signs of
collapse may be seen. Pupils are
dilated and not reacting to light.
There will be multiple hemorrhages,
epistaxis, hematuria,
hemoptysis and petechial
hemorrhages. There may be
complete unconsciousness. Death
takes place due to cardiac failure
within 1-2 days.

Viral fever
is caused by influenza
virus. Transmission is through
inhalation of infected nasopharyngeal
secretions.

Viral hepatitis
is an
acute parenchymal necrotizing
lesion where liver cell necrosis of
hepatitis includes agents A, B, C,
D, E, etc. During active disease
one develops fever, nausea,
vomiting fatigue, anorexia,
headache and chills. There will be
disturbance of taste. One can
develop pruritic rash, arthritis and
altered mental status. Urine will be
dark and stools will be clay
colored. Liver will be enlarged and
tender.

Viral infection
Mumps is caused
by a paramyxovirus. It may
complicate gonads, CNS,
pancreas and myocardium.
Clinical features include sudden
fever, malaise and anorexia. To
start one sided parotid gland is
involved then second is involved.
Parotid gland enlarges for 2-3
days and return to normal within
seven days. Submandibular gland
may also be involved. Most of the
causes are self limiting within a
week. In some children meningitis
or encephalitis may develop.
Antibiotics and cortisone avoid
complications.

Viral oral ulcer
may be primary
herpetic gingivostomatitis. Virus
is transmitted by saliva and direct
contact. Primary infection is
subclinical. Multiple oral ulcers
will result in painful gums,
tongue and sore throat. Lips may
be crushed with blood.
Swallowing, eating, talking will
be painful. Fever, nausea and
vomiting may develop. Initially
develop as vesicles which rupture
later on. Ulcers are multiple and
size is 2 to 3 mm.

Virgin genitals
Question of
virginity appears in case of
marriage, divorce, defamation
and rape. Labia majora are thick,
elastic and will be rounded and
will be in contact with each other
to cover the vulva. Vagina is
narrow and rugosed. Hymen a
firm fold of mucous membrane
may be intact. Hymen may be
ruptured due to sports.

Virulence
is the strength or disease
producing capacity of a pathogen.
The virulence of HIV is much less
than that of hepatitis B virus.
Needle prick involving blood
from HBV carrier is 5 to 30% while
from HIV positive is only 1%.

Virulent
is capable of causing
infection or disease.

Virus infections
cause disease in
mankind. Viruses are obligatory
parasites. They cannot reproduce
outside living cells. Disease
caused by virus includes common
cold, measles, chickenpox,
mumps, AIDS, poliomyelitis and
hepatitis.

Visceral pain
is transmitted mainly
in the fibres which may
accompany sympathetic nerves,
most visceral pain impulses travel
with sympathetic nerves.

Viscosity
is the ability of the
material to flow. Thick or viscous
liquids flow poorly while thin
fluids flow easily. Impression
materials have viscosities
between 100,000 and 100,000 CP.

Visible luminescent spectroscopy
The visible emission spectra and
the fluorescent lifetimes for
decayed and non-decayed
regions of teeth differ. Quasimonochromatic
light from a
tungsten source dispersed with a
grating monochromator was
focused on the teeth. Although,
how exactly it works is unknown,
this is a non-radiological, noninvasive
clinical method to detect
dental caries.

Visual agnosia
is a failure to
identify objects by sight alone
even though visual acuity and
cerebral functions are normal.
Patient may be able to recognize
shape and form but not the image
or object as a whole. He can match
two identical things but cannot
recognize the object as a whole.

Vital capacity
is the maximum
volume of air that can be moved
in or out of lungs.

Vital staining
is the technique
involving administration of
certain dyes to the experimental
animal, which get incorporated to
bone. It is possible to study the
manner in which one is laid
down, site of growth, and the
directions.

Vital statistics
can be referred as a
systematic approach to collect
and compile in numerical form
the information related to vital
events. It is useful for maintaining
records, to maintain control
during execution of program or
to create administrative standard
of health.

Vital theory
considered dental
caries as originating within the
tooth itself, analogous to the bone
gangrene. At the end of
eighteenth century this theory
remained dominant until the
middle of the nineteenth century.
A clinically well known type of
caries is characterized by
extensive penetrations into the
dentin, and even into the pulp,
but with a barely detectable
scratch or a fissure.

Vitamin A
is a fat soluble vitamin,
although vitamin A was not
discovered until 1913, cod liver has
been in use for centuries. It was
chemically synthesized in 1930.
Retinal is found only in foods of
animal origin. Herbivorous obtain
the vitamins from its precursor i.e.
carotenoid pigment. Conversion
of beta-carotene into retinal in
small intestine is only 30 percent.
Absorption of both retinal and
carotene is facilitated by bile salts.
Vitamin E prevents the destruction
of vitamin A in the body. It plays
a crucial role in normal vision and
plays role in immunological
defence mechanism. Liver, egg
yolk, butter, milk and fish are good
sources of vitamin A. yellow
colored carrots ‘pumpkin, papaya
and mango are rich source of
vitamin A. Its deficiency may
cause night blindness, dry skin
and scaly skins. Lack of vitamin A
first causes night blindness or
inability to see in dim light. Mother
can easily detect in children.
Conjuctival xerosis is the first
clinical sign of vitamin A
deficiency. Conjunctiva becomes
dry and non wettable. Instead of
looking smooth and swing it looks
muddy and wrinkled. Bitot’s spots
are triangular, yellowish foamy
spots on bulbar conjunctiva on
either side of cornea.

Vitamin C
is an ascorbic acid and
it is a white crystalline colorless
compound readily soluble in
water. It is a strong reducing
agent. It is comparatively stable
in acid medium but is destroyed
by heat and catalysts such as
copper. Each cigarette smoked
uses up to 25 mg of vitamin C
equivalent of one orange. Being
water soluble it cannot be stored
in body. Vitamin C is a cementing
material which holds the body
cell in place. It helps in absorption
of calcium and iron. Deficiency of
it delays wound healing. Animal
food is a poor source of it and
amla is a richest source. Daily
requirement is 50 mg and has to
be consumed daily. Lemon and
oranges are good source of it.
Guava and drumsticks have high
ascorbic acid content. Leafy vegetables
such as cabbage contain
lesser quantities. Sprouting
converts part of carbohydrate and
pulses into vitamin C.

Vitamin D
a fat soluble vitamin is
intimately connected with the
metabolism of calcium and phosphorous.
It promotes the absorption
of calcium and phosphorous.
It promotes the absorption of calcium
from intestine and helps in
mineralization of bones. It was
synthesized in 1935. Exposing the
skin to the sun enables the ultraviolet
rays to react on the skin’s
surface oil to produce Vitamin D.
The result is not achieved unless
you “strip off” since an intervening
layer of clothing or of glass
impedes the production of Vitamin
D. Vitamin D is found in
small quantities and in a few animal
foods. Foods of plant origin
do not contain Vitamin D.

Vitamin E
was isolated from wheat
germ oil in 1936. It is also known
as anti sterility vitamin.
Chemically it is identified as
tocoferol. This vitamin decreases
oxygen requirement of body.
Foods rich in poly unsaturated
fatty acids are often rich in
vitamin E. Vegetable oils, wheat
germ oil and egg yolk are rich in
vitamin. E. It minimizes wrinkles.
It allows great storage of vit. A. It
is destroyed by food refining.

Vitamin K
was isolated in 1939 by
Damin and his Colleagues.
Coagulation or clotting of blood
is a vitamin K’s role function and
in cases of deficiency hemorrhage
occurs. Limited stores in liver are
maintained. Green vegetables
contain it well so deficiency does
not occur. Soya bean, unrefined
cereals, tomatoes, honey and
wheat germ also supplies it. It is
resistant to heat.

Vitamins
are chemical compounds
made of carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen. Vitamins are soluble in
either water or fat. Solubility
affects their absorption, storage
and excretion. Vitamins do not
provide energy but are required
for the metabolism of food.
Vitamins cannot be synthesized
by the body, if any then quantity
is not sufficient, hence are to be
supplied from outside. Body can
make Vitamin D, Vitamin A and
niacin if the required precursors
are available. Microorganisms of
G. I. Tract can synthesize Vitamin
K and B12 but not to the requirement
of body’s need.

Vitiligo
is a condition where there
is partial or complete loss of
pigment producing melanocytes
within epidermis. Lesions are
already seen in darkly pigmented
individuals. Histologically there
is loss of melanocytes.

Volatile anesthetic agents
Basic
properties of these agents are
(i) liquid at room temperature,
(ii) potent in low concentration
and (iii) more soluble in blood,
cell water and fat than anesthetic
agents. Because of solubility of
these, equilibration is retarded
and induction is slow.

Volvulus
is the rotation of a
segment of intestine on an axis
formed by its mesentery. Cecal
volvulus causes colicky pain in
right abdomen, obstruction and
vomiting with abdominal
distension. Plain X-ray will show
hugely dilated ovoid cecum. To
start single fluid level may be
seen.

Von–Sallman Syndrome

hereditary benign intra-epithelial
dyskeratosis. It is rare autosomal
dominant trait. Patient shows oral
mucosal thickening with
superficial gelatinous looking
plaques on bulbar conjunctiva.

the sole of the foot is pressed
against the couch, the body tries
to walk. It persists as a voluntary
standing.

Walking of the probe
is probing
technique where the probe
should be inserted parallel to the
vertical axis of the tooth and is
‘walked’ circumferentially
around each surface of the tooth
to detect areas of deepest
penetration.

Wallace's "Rule of nine"
is the
most common technique for
assessing the TBSA (total body
surface area). This divides the
body surface into eleven equal
areas each of which is 9% of the
W total or in multiples of 9, e.g. each
upper limb is 9% of the TBSA,
each thigh is 9% of TBSA, each
lower leg is 9% of TBSA, head and
neck is 9%, front of chest is 9%,
back of chest is 9%, front of
abdomen is 9% and back of trunk
is 9%. The perineal area is
remaining 1% of TBSA. However,
this technique cannot be applied
for children because of the
proportionately larger surface
area of head and neck and smaller
area of limbs. Hence modification
is done for calculating BSA
burned in children.

Wallerian degeneration
is the
biochemical and morphological
alterations following trauma
which occur in a nerve due to loss
of continuity of axon.

Warty Dyskeratoma
involves Face,
scalp and neck. Oral lesion are
rare but do occur. These areas are
small, whitish areas of mucosa
with a central depression. Lesion
is to be treated by surgical
excision. There is no malignant
transformation.

Warthin tumor
is a common benign
tumor of salivary gland. These
arise from the lymph nodes with
ectopic salivary tissue. Microscopically
it shows an admixture
of glandular and papillary
epithelial structure.

Wasting
is defined as any gradual
loss of tooth substance which is
characterized by the formation of
smooth, polished surface. The
various forms of wasting are
erosion, abrasion and attrition.

Water
55 to 70% of total body
weight is water. In old age water
content decreases. Fat people
contain less water. Urine contains
87% of water. Water is required
for many chemical changes. Daily
requirement is of 2 to 2.5 litres.
Hypothalamus controls water
balance. Any loss more than 10%
of water is serious.

Water fluoridation
is a procedure
of adding fluoride to community
water supply Grand Rapid’s
experiment in 1943 first showed
conclusive evidence of the success
of water fluoridation. 1ppm
added, to the community water
supply and used over 15 yrs.
Reduced caries were experienced.
By 50% the amount of fluoride
varies with the temperature of the
area and can be calculated using
the formula: -Conc. Of F (PPM) =
0.34/E. Where E = 0.038 + 0.0062
Temperature of the area in F. In
colder climates where water
consumption is reducing, the
concentration of F may be from
1 ppm whereas in hotter climates
only up to 0.7 ppm is needed. In
moderate temperature the
optimum pH conc. is 1 PPM.

Water hammer pulse
is having
rapid upstroke and descent of
pulse wave. It occurs in the case
of aortic regurgitation, increased
stroke volume results in abrupt
upstroke.

Water soluble vitamins
are those
vitamins which are filtered
through the kidneys and excreted
in urine when consumed in
excess. These are generally non
toxic and to be supplied daily.
Body reserve of these vitamins are
minimal, hence toxicity does not
develop. Water soluble vitamins
include vitamin C and B complex
including thiamine, niacin,
riboflavin, pyridoxine, biotin,
cynacobalamine and folate.

Water sorption
means when some
material absorb water. It is known
as water sorption.

Water/powder ratio
is the mixing
proportion of plaster expressed as
a decimal fraction. If 100 gm. of
plaster is to be mixed with 50
gram of water the W/P ratio is
0.50.

Wave length
is the distance
between any two corresponding
points in the wave. A measurement
of physical size, which is
important with respect to how the
laser light is delivered to the
surgical site and to how it reacts
with tissue. Wavelength is
measured in meters; microns
(10-6m) and nanometers (10-9m).

Wedge fracture of vertebra
results
from a flexion force. Posterior
elements are intact. Reduction is
not required.

first described by Wegener in
1936. It is of unknown etiology
involving vascular, renal and
respiratory system. It may occur
at any age. It may develop
rhinitis, sinusitis and Otitis or
ocular symptoms. Hemorrhage
or vascular skin lesions are
common. It is characterized by
necrotizing granulomatous
vasculitis of the respiratory tract
and kidneys. Oral manifestations
includes oral mucosal ulceration,
abnormal tooth mobility, spontaneous
exfoliation of teeth and
delayed healing, Gingival
enlargement may be localized to
a single papilla or generalized, It
appears as a florid, exospheric

gram negative bacillus and
principally affects younger
person and children. Focal
atelectasis, emphysema and
peribronchial infiltration by
lymphocytes are common.
Incubation is 7-16 days. It has 3
stages. In catarrhal stage clinical
picture resembles of respiratory
catarrh. In paroxysmal stage the
diurnal cough becomes paroxysm
of 15-20 short coughs followed by
deep inspiration with closed
glottis producing whoop.
Engorged conjunctiva and
petechial hemorrhage in forehead
and epistaxis are common.
Erythromycin is a drug of choice.

Wickham’s straie
are white raised
areas on the buccal, gingival and
palatal soft tissues. Fungal
infection, oral leukoplakia and
lineal albicans are white but have
different associations and not lacy
in appearance.

sugar present in fruits of different
varieties into alcohol and CO2.
Grapes contain 10 to 20% sugar.
Fermentation is carried out in vats
with the help of selected enzymes.
Agreeable aroma and flavor are
due to various aromatic principles
present in fruits. The special
bouquets develop only after wine
has been aged for periods varying
from four to five years to several
decades. Alcoholic content varies
from 10 to 20%.

Widening of sellaturcica
takes
place due to acromegaly or brain
tumor. AP dimension ranges
about 11 mm and vertical
measure about 8 mm.

Wisdom teeth
means third molar.
Several back molars appear later
in life between 17-25 years of age.
At this age person becomes wise
so are known as wisdom teeth. In
many persons these may remain
imbedded in jaw bone and are
said to be impacted. These have
to be removed otherwise remain
the source of infection.

Working range of wire
is the
maximum deflection of a wire
within the elastic range.

Working time
is the duration from
the start of mixing to the time
when a test rod leaves a permanent
identification in the material
upon withdrawal.

Worm’s theory
is a theory explaining
dental caries. According to the
ancient Sumerian text, toothache
was caused by a worm that drank
the blood of the teeth and fed on
the roots of the jaws. This legend
of the worm was discovered on
one of many clay tablets
excavated. Niffer, Ur, and other
cities within the Euphrates valley
of the lower Mesopotamian area
and estimated to date from about
5000 BC. The idea that caries is
caused by a worm was almost
universal at one time, as
evidenced by the writing of
Homer and popular lore of China,
India, Finland and Scotland.

Xenograft
refers to
Heterograft.

Xerophthalmia
means
where the sebaceous
and hair follicles of
skin and tear glands
of eye become blocked
with horny plugs of
keratin so that their
secretion diminishes. Lack of tears
and heaping up of epithelium on
the sclera and conjunctiva
develops. In conjuctival xerosis
conjunctiva looks muddy and
wrinkled instead of transparent
and clear. It becomes dry.

Xeroradiography
is a technique
that uses modified xerographic
copying techniques to record
images produced by diagnostic
X-rays. They have an additional
feature called “edge enhancement”
effect. Due to these small
structures and areas of subtle
density differences are made more
visible. They contain uniformly
charged selenium plates.
Advantages includes that half of
X-ray radiation is required. 2. It
produces real image. 3. Reflected
light is used. 4. No need for
chemical processing in dark room.
5. This technique is extensively
used in the diagnosis of diseases
of breast.6. It is economical.

Xerostomia
is defined as the
perception of oral dryness. There
is a dryness of mouth and all
degrees of dryness occur. It is
often due to a reduction in
X salivary flow rates of the major
and minor salivary glands.
Humans suffering from decreased
or lack of salivary secretions
often experiences an increased
rate of dental caries and rapid
tooth destruction. Mucosa will
appear dry and atrophic. It may
be pale and translucent. Tongue
may show fissuring and cracking.
It may result in rampant dental
caries.

X-ray absorptiometry
is a
diagnostic test where bone
thickness is usually measured
with bone density scan. Dual
energy X-ray absorptiometry is a
common test to measure bone
thickness in spine, hips and
wrists. This test gives two scores
T score and X score. T score compares
your bone thickness to the
thickness of a healthy 30 years
old. While X score compares your
bone thickness to the bone
thickness of other person of your
age. T score lower than -2.5 means
you have osteoporosis and T1
score between -1 and -2.5 shows
osteopenia.

Xylitol
is the best nutritive sucrose
substitute with respect to caries
prevention. It is non-acidogenic,
hence non-cariogenic. It is also
non-cariogenic by inhibiting the
growth of certain bacteria
stimulating salivary flow and
increasing salivary calcium
concentration.

Yellow brown film
is
a processing error,
where the film
appears brown–yellow due to exhausted
develop or fixer.

Yellow lesions
give
yellow color and are
caused by carotene,
accumulation of pus, exudation of
serum and aggregation of
lymphoid tissue. Yellow color is
seen in ulcers or pustules. Serum
is normally a yellow or straw
colored fluid. Normal lipid
containing structures such as
Fordyce’s granules usually
appear yellow.

Yellow stain
 generally occur from
the food pigments and are also
associated with the presence of
bacterial plaque; it has a dull, light
yellow appearance due to bacterial
plaque which is common to all
ages and more prominent in
patients where personal oral
hygiene is neglected.

Yield stress
is the stress at which
dislocation, motion and
permanent deformation and
plastic flow begin.

Young’s frame
is a U-shaped metal
or plastic form used to hold a
dental dam in place.

score divided by the
standard deviation. It
indicates how many
standard deviations
the raw score is above
or below the mean.

patient develops gingival
fibromatosis with defects of ear,
nose, bones and terminal phalanges.
Joints become hyperflexible.
Spleen is enlarged.

Zinc
is a mineral present in human
body. Average human body
contains 1.4 to 2.3 gram of zinc.
Highest concentrations are found
in liver, bone, prostate and eye. It
is a constituent of insulin. Zinc
plasma level is 96 micro grams per
100 ml in adults. Daily requirement
is 5 to 10 mg. Deficiency of it results

Eugenol is suitable as
a base under metallic restorations
